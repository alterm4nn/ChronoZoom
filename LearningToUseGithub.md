4.	Clone your ChronoZoom repository on Github to your local computer
    - e.g. ‘git clone https://github.com/YourNameHere/ChronoZoom.git’

    - [Normal Workflow](http://learn.github.com/p/normal.html)
5.	Create and switch to a ‘topic branch’ for what you are working on, e.g. ‘git checkout –b newFooBar’
    - [Branching and Merging](http://learn.github.com/p/branching.html)
    - [Git Branching Workflows](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)
6.	Make your changes, commit into the local branch on your computer.
    - [Recording Changes](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)
7.	Push the changes to Github so everyone can see them, e.g. ‘git push origin newFooBar’
    - [Distributed Git](http://learn.github.com/p/remotes.html)
8.	When you’re ready to integrate your changes with the rest of the team, submit a ‘Pull Request’ back to Eugene

## Tips ##
- Do not install ‘Github for Windows’.  This is an ‘easy to use’ tool that doesn’t integrate well with Visual Studio and can interfere with your Git installation.
- I’ve found it best to learn ‘git from the command line’ from the beginning and not rely upon GUI tools too much.  The GUI tools are great to get started, but you’ll rapidly find that you need the power of the command line as you get into the more advanced scenarios and having to ‘relearn’ git from the command line is a waste of time.
