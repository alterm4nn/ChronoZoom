# Contributing Guidelines #

## GitHub Etiquette ##
- Prior to making a pull request, be sure to apply the latest changes from master to your topic branch.
- Add meaningful comments when you make your commits.

## Code Style ##
- Use the project's coding style, not your own. Follow the existing code as an example of what to do.
- Use [Stylecop](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/) to ensure that your code is conformant with project style.

## Unit Tests ##
Prior to submitting you must run unit tests on your code.

## Reporting Issues ##
A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by code in the repository.

Please read the following guidelines before you report an [issue][issues]:

1. **Use GitHub issue search** to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, please comment on the existing issue.

1. **Check whether the issue has been fixed** &mdash; The latest `master` or development branch may already contain a fix.

1. **Isolate the demonstrable problem** &mdash; make sure that the code in the
   project's repository is _definitely_ responsible for the issue. 

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. 

### Example of a good bug report:

> Short and descriptive title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` (a link to the test case)
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
