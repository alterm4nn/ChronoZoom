The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater. This is a drawing of a black hole depicting the accretion lines.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/e6361738-df76-4ca1-a7db-949a4a5013ed_872-blackhole.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":683,"Order":32767},{"id":"f6c765f3-2880-4f59-9fe4-82f404a5f8f0","parent":"05244045-5d81-456a-80f6-2708cfff6f9a","title":"Oldest Recorded Supernova","description":"In larger stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large (more than 1.4 solar masses) that it can no longer support its own mass.

Supernovae are so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. Most of the matter in the star is blown away by the supernova explosion and what remains will be a neutron star (which sometimes manifests itself as a pulsar or X-ray burster) or, in the case of the largest stars (large enough to leave a stellar remnant greater than roughly 4 solar masses), a black hole.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/f6c765f3-2880-4f59-9fe4-82f404a5f8f0_859-supernova.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":657,"Order":32767},{"id":"428b173f-4e31-410d-9d88-f4fe94698289","parent":"05244045-5d81-456a-80f6-2708cfff6f9a","title":"Salman Kahn Explains the Birth of Stars","description":"In this video you will learn how star formation starts over great distances of space with gravity pulling together prodigious amounts of hydrogen atoms.

The mitochondria uses that differential to generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The basic breakdown of glucose occurs in three steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis actually takes place outside of the mitochondria and involves the splitting of the glucose molecule in half. These halves then move into the mitochondria into the Citric Acid cycle.

This makes it hydrophobic and avoid water. When millions of these molecules are put together, they create membranes that have two layers of these lipids, with the heads facing outward toward the water, and the tails facing inward towards each other avoiding the water.

It is what you would call a ribozyme since it is an enzyme (protein) and a ribonucelotide. The way translation occurs is that the mRNA is fed through the ribosome and this ribosome reads it, three letters at a time. There are 64 different combinations, but only 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, so some amino acids have several three letter codes.

The nuclear envelope is a double lipid bilayer that likely originated from an infolding of the cells normal membrane meaning the nuclear membrane is twice as thick as the regular cell membrane. Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA. Most DNA is not actually genes that code for something important, but rather junk DNA that is there to absorb damage and protect the genes from damage, and then most genes aren't expressed in every cell, only a small subset are.

When sexual reproduction appeared, organisms became more resilient because they had two sets of genes and became what is known as diploid. That is why we humans have 46 chromosomes, but we say we have 23 pairs. This allows for interesting mixes in recessives and dominants to allow for more variation and natural selection. The alternation of generations concept is that some organisms live part of their life cycle as haploids and part as diploids.

This has many implications for its ability to dissolve ions, needed in metabolism and homeostasis, as well as other polar molecules, allowing cell membranes to form. This polarity is also involved in how ice is structured, making water's solid state less dense than its liquid state, meaning that ice will float above oceans, insulating them rather than having them freeze from the bottom up.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/842c0e2c-7cd8-45f1-8e44-c8ef2736ad3a_800px-Drops_Imapct.JPG","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":1021,"Order":3}],"UniqueID":119}],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":307,"Regime":"Life","Height":40.0},{"id":"a6b821df-2a4d-4f0e-baf5-28e47ecb720b","parent":"d4809be4-3cf9-4ddd-9703-3ca24e4d3a26","start":-8500000.0,"end":0.0,"title":"Human Prehistory","exhibits":[{"id":"39e60e56-0256-4586-a912-d0caf3663cdf","parent":"a6b821df-2a4d-4f0e-baf5-28e47ecb720b","time":-7000000.0,"title":"Threshold 6: Origins of Human Beings","description":"","contentItems":[{"id":"6fdbb18f-96b2-41bf-be7f-82e7de1d6622","parent":"39e60e56-0256-4586-a912-d0caf3663cdf","title":"Evolution of Hominoidea","description":"This is a phylogenetic tree showing the extant hominoids: humans (genus Homo), chimpanzees (genus Pan), gorillas (genus Gorilla), orangutans (genus Pongo), and gibbons (four genera of the family Hylobatidae: Hylobates, Hoolock, Nomascus, and Symphalangus).

However Ostia’s harbour was too small to admit large ships like those which carried grain, an essential import for the populous capital. Large ships either had to dock further out and have smaller ships unload their cargo piecemeal or dock into the harbour at Pozzuoli and have the cargo unloaded and then taken overland to Rome. \r\nSuetonius notes (Diuus Claudius XX.1) that the creation of a large harbour to accommodate these ships was considered and then abandoned by Julius Caesar in the first century BC as too difficult an undertaking. Despite the enormity of the project and its substantial cost, Claudius initiated the construction of the large artificial harbour on the north side of the Tiber mouth in AD 42.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/32212042-5a4d-45aa-9e5f-8a6ec0a315f3_Phase1 Pharos VR.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":991,"Order":32767},{"id":"c07627ff-167b-44a6-b162-54ccdae0de72","parent":"42446679-e1ec-4fe4-8311-050db18e6841","title":"Marble statue of Emperor Claudius","description":"Marble statue of Emperor Claudius found at Gabii and currently at the Louvre Museum, Paris.

A new hexagonal harbour basin was excavated inland behind the Claudian basin and associated infrastructure was constructed around it including warehouses, a possible ship shed, a temple and an expansive and lavishly decorated administrative building which was later dubbed the Palazzo Imperiale. At least one canal, mentioned by Pliny (Epistulae VIII.17.1-2) and possibly also referred to in a fragmentary inscription (CIL XIV 88 = CIL VI 964), was created by Trajan as well. The inauguration of Trajan’s work at Portus was commemorated with a coin issue displaying a bird’s eye view of the hexagonal harbour on the reverse.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/16fa5727-d77a-4867-a1ab-f40a74704fb8_Phase4 DSC_9442 stairs.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":994,"Order":1},{"id":"16f4b589-47be-47a8-a827-41699f59f482","parent":"c6f73c01-7e16-4149-89a8-e774ec4fd658","title":"Trajanic Phase","description":"Plan showing Trajanic phase","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/16f4b589-47be-47a8-a827-41699f59f482_Phase4 Harbour Traj to be edited.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":1052,"Order":3}],"UniqueID":327},{"id":"b97fc7f0-3b85-4711-854d-79d7bdd9a4ae","parent":"c711aa50-118e-4fa8-a17c-d122334cc670","time":-1899.0,"title":"Imperial Palace","description":"","contentItems":[{"id":"68408352-360b-4dd6-856d-cca4c8a6728d","parent":"b97fc7f0-3b85-4711-854d-79d7bdd9a4ae","title":"Imperial Palace","description":"The Palazzo Imperiale was a brick- and reticulate-faced concrete structure which covered nearly three hectares.

The jang chang was widely used in the battle to retake the Pyong-yang Fortress during the 1592 war between Chosun (Korea) and Japan.

Soldiers learned gwonbeop prior to learning more complex weapons arts to master footwork and body control. It was also taught as a method of personal self-defense for Joseon warriors. Quan fa is a generic term used for open handed Chinese martial arts. Gwonbeop was developed based on the methods of the Shaolin Temple and the techniques of Jang Song Gye (장송계 hanja: 張松溪). The hanja for quan fa and gwonbeop are the same. The chapter in the muyedobotongji dealing with gwonbeop was inspired by Chinese writings describing quan fa-techniques.

The government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from senior first rank (정1품) down to junior ninth rank (종9품) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examinations and recommendations. The power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual. Political struggles were common between different factions of the scholar-officials. Purges frequently resulted in leading political figures being sent into exile or condemned to death.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/42287aef-067f-4edf-ae32-02bf2463655b_911-joseonpolitics.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":816,"Order":32767},{"id":"7c855711-f87f-4ef2-a0fe-97d789077b5a","parent":"8439a3b1-bb7e-49ed-9bf3-5a39a7ac245a","title":"The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty","description":"The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (also known as The True Record of the Joseon Dynasty) are the annual records of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, which were kept from 1413 to 1865.

Scientists increasingly see their instruments through online scientific archives and analysis tools, rather than examining the raw data. Today this analysis is primarily driven by scientists asking queries, but scientific archives are becoming active databases that self-organize and recognize interesting and anomalous facts as data arrives. In some fields, data from many different archives can be cross-correlated to produce new insights. Astronomy presents an excellent example of these trends; and, federating Astronomy archives presents interesting challenges for computer scientists.","uri":"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/82410583?access_key=key-19mhzmz32tdlfhod9ces","mediaType":"Video","UniqueID":638,"Order":6},{"id":"574a209e-0ddb-42b8-af81-1901935228ad","parent":"c26cfd4b-742b-42cf-bfbe-51ae7e8545ed","title":"Where the Rubber Meets the Sky: Bridging the Gap between Databases and Science","description":"Abstract: Scientists in all domains face a data avalanche – both from better instruments and from improved simulations.

Sauropods were the extreme example, growing to sizes sometimes of over 100 feet in length, they used their size as a deterrent against predators and to control a niche in their environment that no other creature could access. They were eating machines designed to process huge amounts of foliage. And they did so so quickly that they had not time to chew. In fact, they ate small stones so that the plant matter would get ground up within their stomach's.
