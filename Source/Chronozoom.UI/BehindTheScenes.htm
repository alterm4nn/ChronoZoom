<h1>ChronoZoom Behind the Scenes</h1>

<p>ChronoZoom is an open source community project owned by the Outercurve 
Foundation and dedicated to visualizing the history of everything. &nbsp;ChronoZoom 
bridges the gap between the humanities and sciences using a notion of “Big 
History” to easily understand all this information. This project has been funded 
and supported by Microsoft Research Connections in collaboration with University 
California at Berkeley, Moscow State University and University of Washington 
Information School (IS) and Web and Data Science (WDS) departments.</p>

<p>You can browse through all of history on ChronoZoom to find data in the form of 
articles, images, video, sound, and other multimedia. ChronoZoom links together 
a wealth of information that has been curated by experts and enthusiasts to tell 
important stories from history. By drawing upon the latest discoveries from many 
different disciplines, you can visualize the temporal relationships between 
events, trends, and themes. Some of the disciplines that contribute information 
to ChronoZoom include biology, astronomy, geology, climatology, prehistory, 
archeology, anthropology, economics, cosmology, natural history, and population 
and environmental studies.</p>

<h2>Latest News:</h2>

<p>ChronoZoom is under active development in 2013 with exciting new features due 
out
this summer. We have moved the development of
<a href="https://github.com/alterm4nn/ChronoZoom">ChronoZoom to Github</a> where you can download the source code.
Most importantly, you will soon be able to create your own content in ChronoZoom!
Publish your academic insights on history in a novel way for your doctorate
or put together a timeline of your family – ChronoZoom will help your story shine either way.</p>

<p>Watch this space as we will soon be launching a new community site!</p>

<h2>Early History</h2>

<p>In the spring of 2009 Walter Alvarez was teaching a Big History course at the 
University of California Berkeley where he and then-student Roland Saekow began 
collaborating on ideas for an interactive timeline application to help teach the course. 
After the creation of an early prototype, Microsoft Research was engaged and 
Microsoft Live Labs produced the first live version of ChronoZoom. Since then, 
a beta version was published and now version 1.0 is being built in 2013 by 
Microsoft Research Connections (MRC), University of California Berkeley, 
Moscow State University and University of Washington with participation of both 
the Information School and the Web and Data Sciences departments. </p>
