It is hypothesized that they have similar origins to mitochondria in that they were originally free living cyanobacteria that were ingested and later evolved within larger eukaryotic cells as endosymbionts. The function of chloroplasts is to generate organic molecules, especially simple sugars such as glucose, from CO2 and H2O. This is an extremely important function ecologically since it recycles inorganic molecules and creates molecules we can gain sustenance from by using solar energy. It carries out its functions through thylakoids and has two sets of reactions: light dependent which use chlorophyll A and B to break down water and create oxygen, and light independent (or Calvin cycle) which actually create the simple sugars and fixes carbon dioxide.",

In fact these same proteins are what allow for many types of cellular locomotion such as pseudopod motion. Many proteins move across these tubes and filaments in order to move objects accurately to their destination. In animal cells, structures known as centrosomes made up of these tubes help guide mitosis, or cellular division. ",

The energy it generates comes from breaking high energy bonds in organic molecules, which is released when these molecules form new low energy bonds as CO2 and H2O. The mitochondria uses that differential to generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The basic breakdown of glucose occurs in three steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis actually takes place outside of the mitochondria and involves the splitting of the glucose molecule in half. These halves then move into the mitochondria into the Citric Acid cycle. There the complete breakdown occurs. Finally all these electron carrier molecules pass through ATP synthase and for a total of around 32 ATP per glucose molecule. It is thought mitochondria originally were separate organisms that evolved inside eukaryotic cells and are now endosymbionts.",

These have a head which is made up of a diglyceride and phosphate group, making it polar and therefore hydrophilic. This means it is attracted to water and can be dissolved in it easily. They also have a tail which is made up of a long chain of hydrocarbons making it non-polar. This means it is similar chemically to oily substances and has a difficult time dissolving in water. This makes it hydrophobic and avoid water. When millions of these molecules are put together, they create membranes that have two layers of these lipids, with the heads facing outward toward the water, and the tails facing inward towards each other avoiding the water. They can hold themselves together fairly well because of these inter-molecular forces but are also slightly permeable to water which allows for osmosis to take place.",

To do this, the cell utilizes ribosomes, organelles that are made up of both protein and rRNA, or ribosomal RNA. It is what you would call a ribozyme since it is an enzyme (protein) and a ribonucelotide. The way translation occurs is that the mRNA is fed through the ribosome and this ribosome reads it, three letters at a time. There are 64 different combinations, but only 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, so some amino acids have several three letter codes. As these codes are read, tRNAs with complimentary three letter sequences and one amino acid bound to them enter the ribosome from the top and begin assembling a chain of amino acids that will later become a protein.",

The nuclear envelope is a double lipid bilayer that likely originated from an infolding of the cells normal membrane meaning the nuclear membrane is twice as thick as the regular cell membrane. Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA. Most DNA is not actually genes that code for something important, but rather junk DNA that is there to absorb damage and protect the genes from damage, and then most genes aren't expressed in every cell, only a small subset are. The mRNA acts as a messenger of genetic information that exits the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it can be translated into proteins.",

Around 600 million years ago, the world was thrust into this ice age because much of the CO2 in the atmosphere was sequestered by plankton and taken out of the carbon cycle by being deposited as limestone. This reduction in greenhouse gases caused temperatures to plummet to an extraordinary degree, causing a global winter that only subsided after enough CO2 had been returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes. It is thought that this pressure on life around at the time sped up evolution and created the more resilient body plans that we see today.",

Previously organisms were haploid, meaning they had one set of genes and that was it. This made them more prone to genetic diseases and if there was a harmful mutation in a vital gene, they would perish. When sexual reproduction appeared, organisms became more resilient because they had two sets of genes and became what is known as diploid. That is why we humans have 46 chromosomes, but we say we have 23 pairs. This allows for interesting mixes in recessives and dominants to allow for more variation and natural selection. The alternation of generations concept is that some organisms live part of their life cycle as haploids and part as diploids. Though we humans only have a short haploid phase as sperm and eggs, some fungi live mostly in a haploid state, while more primitive plants can be half in half living as sporophytes (diploid) or gametophytes (haploid).",

Somewhere within this timeframe, all the modern lineages must have appeared and then suddenly diversified during the Cambrian explosion. The first true organs were developed somewhere during this time and can be found in flatworms and higher. They consist of parenchyma tissue which is the main component and stroma which differ but connect the organ to other systems.The development of true organs, rather than just specialized tissues is what ultimately kicked evolution into overdrive and is what makes the Phanaerozoic so full of macroscopic life",

They also only have two germ layers from which all other cells originate whereas higher animals have 3 layers. They can be distinguished into medusas if their mouth cavity points down or polyps if it points up.  Some coral are unique and create large colonies that leave huge limestone deposits behind creating the vast reefs we see on tropical islands.

Though we do acquire energy when we consume them and we need them to survive, the actual source of energy for our bodies is a molecule called Adenosine Triphosphate, abbreviated as ATP. It is the universal molecule that cells use as an energy source to carry out its functions. What make's ATP so energetically charged is the fact that it has three very negatively charged phosphate groups bound very closely to one another. This repelling force held so closely together allows ATP to transmit it's energy to other systems by \"phosphorylating\" them. Essentially what this means is that some of that stored energy can be passed on to another system (such as an enzyme) by giving one of it's phosphate groups to it. To restore itself to ATP it needs to break down a complex molecule, continuing the cycle.",

Cells will use oxygen's high reactivity to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, and using the energy that process releases to carry their own cellular functions. The simplest version of this is the breakdown of glucose, the product of photosynthesis. It takes place in 3 steps main steps, the first where the glucose is split in half into two pyruvates. The second, or Krebb's Cycle, is where the pyruvates are broken down and used to produce a lot of NADHs, a carrier molecule.

Most elements want to be like Noble Gases (elements in the column of helium), which are non-reactive. This is because this is the lowest energy state they can be in, and is the basis for a concept known as electronegativity. An element is electronegative if it will try to gain electrons and an electropositive one will try to get rid of them. Oxygen is a good oxidizer, meaning it is good at accepting electrons because it is very electronegative. This makes it very reactive and capable of bonding with many different compounds. This makes it good for breaking down complex compounds and harnessing a lot of energy from them, allowing for much more chemistry and biological properties.",

Granted there are several exceptions to this rule since there are bacteria that exist in the deep places of the earth that form the basis of food chains without the need for sun, through a process called chemiosynthesis. But for the most part, life depends on the Sun for energy. How this works on a molecular level is that plants use photons from the Sun (in the blue and red part of the spectrum, reflecting green back which is what we see) to break the bonds in water and CO2, and form new, higher energy bonds as sugars and they use chlorophyll as a pigment to do this. This sugars can then be broken down to create energy as ATP to power the production of other organic molecules, or used to build cell walls as cellulose, or stored as starch. As animals eat plants and the energy moves up the food chain, these high energy bonds move up as well, meaning we all run on solar power.",

A variety of traits make it a good element to bond with and to create long polymers such as its ability to make 4 bonds, its ability to make stronger double and triple bonds, hybridized orbitals (where structures are stabilized and can transfer energy through electron resonance), and it's ability to hold positive or negative charges under different conditions depending on the bond needed to be made. This versatility is seen as it transforms through the environment as inorganic gaseous CO2 into organic sugars, fats and amino acids and then back into CO2. It can be subducted under the Earth's crust and then released by volcanoes as gas. It can even be dissolved in the oceans and act as a buffer against pH changes as bicarbonate. Without this cycle, life would go extinct very quickly, since carbon would accumulate in some form or another.",

Once most iron on earth was rusted, the oxygen would have started to accumulate in the atmosphere, creating the ozone layer, an unstable form of three oxygen atoms bonded together, shielding life from harmful UV rays. However, not all the changes were good, the corrosive nature of oxygen meant that a lot of organisms were either damaged by it or the chemicals they utilized for metabolism disappeared or were confined to niche extreme environments.

Carbon forms the backbone to these polymers and is what all other elements attach to when forming large biological molecules.

Sometimes they aid proteins in cell-to-cell signaling. Lipids or fats are similar but tend to have less oxygen and dissolve more poorly in water.

Phospholipids which make cell membranes, triglycerides which serve as energy storage and steroids which work as hormones or cell to cell signaling. ",

At some point, in order for life to arise it would have needed to compartmentalize itself away from the external environment, which is why cell membranes arose. These droplets which are similar to modern liposomes, or membranes without the cell inside, would have had the basic materials inside to replicate and create more identical droplets.

It is very stable and has a high boiling point for a molecule of its size, allowing it to be liquid over a wide range of temperatures. It can absorb a lot of energy without raising its temperature much, allowing heat from chemical reactions to dissipate. It is a polar molecule: the oxygen holds the electron's slightly closer to itself than the hydrogens do placing a slight negative charge on the oxygen and a positive charge on the hydrogen. This has many implications for its ability to dissolve ions, needed in metabolism and homeostasis, as well as other polar molecules, allowing cell membranes to form. This polarity is also involved in how ice is structured, making water's solid state less dense than its liquid state, meaning that ice will float above oceans, insulating them rather than having them freeze from the bottom up.",

However Ostia’s harbour was too small to admit large ships like those which carried grain, an essential import for the populous capital. Large ships either had to dock further out and have smaller ships unload their cargo piecemeal or dock into the harbour at Pozzuoli and have the cargo unloaded and then taken overland to Rome. \r\nSuetonius notes (Diuus Claudius XX.1) that the creation of a large harbour to accommodate these ships was considered and then abandoned by Julius Caesar in the first century BC as too difficult an undertaking. Despite the enormity of the project and its substantial cost, Claudius initiated the construction of the large artificial harbour on the north side of the Tiber mouth in AD 42.",

A bronze coin issued in AD 64 commemorates the inauguration of the harbour at Portus under the emperor Nero. However the planning and construction of Portus appear to have been organized in such a way as to enable the harbour to function at a very early date as evidenced by the presence and destruction of two hundred ships in the harbour two years previous. Also Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia IX.5.14-15) relates the story of Claudius trapping a killer whale at Portus by closing off the mouth of the harbour with nets and then engaging it in combat.",

A new hexagonal harbour basin was excavated inland behind the Claudian basin and associated infrastructure was constructed around it including warehouses, a possible ship shed, a temple and an expansive and lavishly decorated administrative building which was later dubbed the Palazzo Imperiale. At least one canal, mentioned by Pliny (Epistulae VIII.17.1-2) and possibly also referred to in a fragmentary inscription (CIL XIV 88 = CIL VI 964), was created by Trajan as well. The inauguration of Trajan’s work at Portus was commemorated with a coin issue displaying a bird’s eye view of the hexagonal harbour on the reverse.",

A bishop from the ‘Portus Romae’ is mentioned as having attended the Council of Arles in AD 314. In a letter written in AD 398, Saint Jerome (Epistulae LXXVII.10.1-3) refers to the establishment of a hostel at Portus to provide hospitality for Christians travellers. South of the mouth of the Trajanic harbour basin, an early form of a Christian basilica (consisting of a nave demarcated from the flanking aisles with a row of eight columns) is built in the mid-fourth century AD with further additions and renovations undertaken at the end of the fourth century through to the sixth century AD.",

In AD 537, they seized Portus and, now having Rome’s crucial supply link in their possession, the Ostrogoths then besieged Rome (Procopius, History of the Wars of Justinian V.26.3-19). The siege lasted a year and resulted in disease and famine for both sides since although the Ostrogoths held Portus, the Byzantines had control of the seas.

After Totila was defeated by Narses at the Battle of Taginae in AD 552, the remnants of the Ostrogothic force present at Rome retreated to Portus. Too few in number to defend themselves against the advancing Byzantines, the Ostrogoths surrendered and the Byzantines seized control of Portus once again.",

However, their historical role may have been exaggerated since \"the entire Korean fleet probably did not have more than half a dozen turtleboats in action at any one time\". Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin is credited with designing the ship. His turtle ships were equipped with at least five different types of cannons. Their most distinguishable feature was a dragon-shaped head at the bow (front) that could launch cannon fire or flames from the mouth. Each was also equipped with a fully covered deck to deflect arrow fire, musket-shots, and incendiary weapons. The deck was covered with iron spikes to discourage enemy men from attempting to board the ship. Claims that it was iron plated remain controversial.",

On July 8, 1592, the fleet arrived at the Bay of Sacheon, where the outgoing tide prevented the Korean fleet from entering. Therefore, Admiral Yi ordered the fleet to feign withdrawal, which the Japanese commander observed from his tent on a rock. Then the Japanese hurriedly embarked their 12 ships and pursued the Korean fleet. The Korean navy counterattacked, with their newly completed Turtle Ship in the front, and successfully destroyed all 12 ships. Admiral Yi was shot by a bullet in his left shoulder, but survived successfully leading the Koreans to a resounding victory in the battle.",

The first references to older, first generation turtle ships, known as Gwiseon (귀선), come from 1413 and 1415 though they are more famous for their role in the Japanese Invasion of Korea in the 16th century. The turtle ship was the fastest and most maneuverable existing warship in the East Asian theater, as it was powered by two sails and 80 oarsmen taking turns to handle the ship's 16 oars. Its primary role was to cut deep into the enemy lines, cause havoc with its cannons, and destroy the enemy flag ship.",

Yi Hwang had retired to the location in 1549 and begun construction on the facility, a private Korean Confucian academy offering instruction in the classics and honouring the sages with regular memorial rites. Like other Korean Confucian academies, Dosan Seowon serves two purposes: education and commemoration. The site was well known in Korea as one of the leading academies and was home to the Toegye School of Thought for over 400 years. Although the educational function of the facility has long since ceased, the commemorative ceremonies have been and are still held twice a year.",

The power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual. Political struggles were common between different factions of the scholar-officials. Purges frequently resulted in leading political figures being sent into exile or condemned to death.",

The weapon was preferably made from the yew tree, but other wood could be used as well. It was considered the most effective conventional weapon on the battlefield due to its flexibility and length.

Soldiers learned gwonbeop prior to learning more complex weapons arts to master footwork and body control. It was also taught as a method of personal self-defense for Joseon warriors. Quan fa is a generic term used for open handed Chinese martial arts. Gwonbeop was developed based on the methods of the Shaolin Temple and the techniques of Jang Song Gye (장송계 hanja: 張松溪). The hanja for quan fa and gwonbeop are the same. The chapter in the muyedobotongji dealing with gwonbeop was inspired by Chinese writings describing quan fa-techniques.

The Woldo (literally “moon blade”), was a Korean pole weapon that closely resembled the Chinese guandao (also known as yanyuedao), though proportionally smaller. It was so named because of its curved blade. The Muyedobotongji describes its design: “The length of the handle is six feet, four inches; the length of the blade is two feet, eight inches; and the weight is three pounds, 15 ounces.” It usually had a spike on the end of the handle, and a feather or tassel attached by a ring to the back of the blade. There was a variant of the woldo, called the danwoldo, which had a bigger blade.",

In response to outside pressure, he attempted to censor the Tongnip Sinmun after its criticisms of pro-Russia conservatives and its publication of secret Russian and Japanese documents exposing plans to exact concessions from the Korean government in December 1987. The foreign community feared that an active press might interfere with \"concession diplomacy\" by mobilizing the Korean public against the granting of special privileges to foreign interests. Ultimately, the government decided to expel Seo from Korea and allow the continued publication of the paper under Yun Chi-ho.",

Thwarted by conservative factions within the Joseon court, particularly the pro-Chinese Sugup'a, they launched a coup d'état attempt with Japanese support, seizing the royal palace in Seoul. Facing this threat, Queen Min secretly requested Qing military intervention, and after three days, the revolt was suppressed by 1500 troops of the Qing garrison led by General Yuan Shikai.",

The coup was aborted in three days, as China intervened by sending military troops. Convicted of treason, Seo Jae-Pil lost his whole family and had to flee Korea for the United States to save his life. In 1894, Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese war which occurred in the Korean Peninsula, and the Korean cabinet was filled with reformists who pardoned Jaisohn enabling his return in 1895. In Korea, he endeavored to politically educate people. He published The Independent to transform Korean people into an informed citizenry.",

It constituted two different language editions: Korean and English. Originally, it was published every other day, but it developed into a daily newspaper in Korean with an estimated average circulation of between two and three thousand copies. The Tongnip Sinmun was historic in terms of its contribution to, and impact on Korean political and intellectual history, generally raising awareness despite a corrupt government that eventually forced its demise.

This model ushered in a new age of astronomy. It positioned the Sun motionless near the center of the Universe with Earth and the other planets rotating around it in circular paths, modified by epicycles and at uniform speeds. The Copernican model departed from the Ptolemaic system that had prevailed in Western culture for centuries before. ",

From his observations, Kepler elucidated three laws that describe the motions of celestial bodies in orbit, such as planets around the Sun. Kepler's laws are: 1. The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. 2. A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. 3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. ",

He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\" by a newspaper reporter, he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large teamwork to the process of invention, and therefore is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. He is also the fourth most prolific inventor in history, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. ",

It is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the four-momentum (mass-energy and linear momentum) of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.",

The Pacific Ocean comprises one-third of the surface area of the earth.  The Americas (South, Central and North) plus the Atlantic Ocean comprise an additional one-third of earth’s surface. Thus, the AfroEurAsian Old World (including the Indian Ocean) must comprise the remaining one-third of earth’s surface. Designation of extensive contacts throughout the AfroEurAsian Old World as early “globalization” – as some scholars claim -- is an oxymoron in that the Old World comprises only one-third of the surface area of the globe. It was not until the 16th century that humans connected all heavily-populated landmasses intimately, giving birth to the modern global system.\r\n",

His invention is widely cited as the beginning of the Horological Revolution. The pendulum clock, and the other innovations that accompanied it thereafter, allowed for the production of clocks that were cheaper and more accurate. For the first time, people outside the aristocracy and royalty could afford to own clocks and even more importantly pocket watches, which allowed for personalized timekeeping. Prior to Huygens, clocks could not be relied on for accuracy beyond an expected error of 15 minutes per day. The pendulum helped reduce that margin of error to about 10-15 seconds.",

In 1748, Franklin wrote \"Advice to a Young Tradesman,\" which recommended that one should “remember that time is money.” Franklin described the meaning of this proverb by comparing a man's earnings for an entire day's work to the earnings of a man who idles half the day. “Though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness,” Franklin explained, “he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.” Because one can earn wages from an hour's work, an hour wasted is the equivalent of losing those same wages in addition to the money that was spent during such leisure time.",

Smiles' most famous work, Self-Help, represents a great many beliefs at the heart of British cultural identity. This identity included a belief in the phrase \"time is money.\" Smiles advised that time should be “employed in good works.” If hours of indolence were put to proper use, they would “make an ignorant man wise in a few years.”",

The character of Oliver Fearnleaf could “see many compensations arising from the absence of a watch” given that the “sights, shapes and sounds” could be his time markers “and the whole world was [his] clock.” Waugh imagined Fearnleaf finding that his watch had swallowed up “a good deal of pocket money” in maintenance costs. The watch became “a continual source of anxiety” and so Fearnleaf got rid of it. This suggests an attitude towards timekeeping that may not have been obvious to those writing about an apparently self-evident need for time reform. Waugh does ascribe one significant inconvenience to lacking an accurate watch: Oliver Fearnleaf always misses the train...",

She had inherited the job from her mother, Maria Belville (pictured above), who in turn received the position at the time of her own husband's death. Maria's husband, John Henry Belville, started the business by virtue of working in the Royal Observatory during the midcentury period when Greenwich Mean Time first gained national prominence.",

After the expiration of Watt's patent in 1800, others created more fuel-efficient, high-pressure engine designs. This schematic depicts an early steam carriage, designed by 17th century French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. It was modified to transport large pieces of artillery as a gun-carriage. This early model could only run for several minutes at a time, and moved at about 2 mph. ",

Cold water was injected only into the condenser, allowing for condensation without significant heat loss and far greater fuel efficiency than the Newcomen engine.",

His most important innovation was the patent of an early steam engine mechanism in 1698. Harnessing the \"impellent force of fire\" by burning coal, Savery's engine was primarily designed to pump water, aiding in the drainage of mines and providing towns with water. Although Savery's initial design proved to be impractical due to several key flaws, it laid the foundation for more effective designs in the 18th century.",

WIthout the invention of Eli Whitney's cotton gin, this tedious separation process would otherwise be performed painstakingly by hand. The cleaned cotton would then be spun into yarn, using spinning wheels. The seeds may later be used to grow more cotton or to produce cottonseed oil.

This ban increased incentive for innovation by British textile producers. ",

The Great Stink, or the Big Stink, was a time in the summer of 1858 which the smell of untreated human waste was very strong in central London. Until the late 16th century London citizens relied on water from shallow wells, the River Thames, its tributaries, or natural springs so the water was not abstracted for unauthorised commercial or industrial purposes. For seven years human waste was dumped into the Thames and then potentially pumped back to the same households for drinking, cooking and bathing. ",

Maritime trade between England and China began in the 17th century. However, there was a far greater European demand for Chinese goods, such as tea, silk, and porcelain, and little Chinese interest in European goods. As a result, Chinese goods were paid for in silver. In an attempt to stem and reverse the vast flow of silver out of Britain, the East India Company began to sell the addictive and mass-appealing effects of Indian-produced opium to Chinese dealers, in exchange for silver. Recognizing the effects of addiction in its population, Chinese leaders placed bans on opium save in small amounts for medicinal purposes. However, opium continued to be smuggled into and sold in China in the mid-19th century, where tensions culminated in the First and Second Opium Wars.",

Coal is destructively distilled in a coke oven to produce coke, a form of fuel for stoves and furnaces. The production of and use of coke was pioneered by English Quaker Abraham Darby in the early 18th century. Darby used coke instead of charcoal to smelt iron, resulting in a higher quality product. Iron production in Britain skyrocketed in the 18th century, and became prominent in all manners of construction.",

Queen Victoria was the monarch of the UK of Great Britain and Ireland from 1837 until her death. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, when the UK was already an established constitutional monarchy, in which the Sovereign held relatively few direct political powers. She privately attempted to influence government policies and ministerial appointments. Publicly, she became a national icon and was identified with strict standards of personal morality. ",

Carnegie Steel Company was a steel producing company created by Andrew Carnegie to manage business at his steel mills in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area in the late 19th century. Because of Carnegie, it now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and armor plate for the US Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. Carnegie installed improved systems that greatly sped up the process of steelmaking and allowed the production of far vaster quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force (especially the less skilled workers) also grew rapidly. ",

The piece was initially commissioned by the King of Spain, and depicts a highly romanticized rendition of Bonaparte's crossing of the Alps through the Great St. Bernard Pass in May 1800. Five separate versions of this painting were created, at Bonaparte's request, to be displayed in different prominent buildings. The above image is the original version, which remained in Madrid until 1812, before being taken to the United States by Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother. It currently resides at the museum of the Château de Malmaison in France.",

The revolution ended in failure after the insurgents were crushed by the authorities. However, as a result, a new constitution was established, stating that a president was to be elected by the people every four years.

The opening day of the LM&R was greeted with much fanfare, although the festivities were tragically marred by the death of Liverpool Member of Parliament William Huskisson, who accidentally fell onto the tracks and was killed by an oncoming train. Despite its sombre beginnings, the L&MR rapidly grew to be a tremendous success.",

France's railway system was more slowly developed than those of other industrialized nations of the time. In 1842, the French government created legislation to build a national railway system. Most of the main lines were completed by the 1860s. Unlike many other countries where private companies played large roles in railway construction, France's rail system was built largely by the state. ",

It held session from May 18, 1848 to May 31, 1849. The Assembly, after long and arduous debate, produced the Frankfurt Constitution, which aimed to create a unified German Empire governed by the principles of parliamentary democracy. This was ultimately an unsuccessful attempt, as most German states were not willing to give up sovereignty, resulting in the restoration of the German Confederation just a year later.",

Inaugurated in 1883, the monument was constructed to commemorate the founding of German Empire after the end of Franco-Prussian War. The first stone of the monument was laid by first German Emperor Wilhelm I in 1871. The central figure is the 10.5-meter tall sculpture of Germania, holding the recovered crown of the emperor and the imperial sword. Beneath Germania is a large relief showing Emperor Wilhelm I on horseback with nobility, army commanders and soldiers. The relief is engraved with the lyrics of the German patriotic anthem, \"Die Wacht am Rhein\" (\"Watch on the Rhine\"). Peace and war statues adorn the left and right sides of the monument, respectively. ",

Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to end a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia, and as a result emancipation committees were formed. The Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. ",

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 began as a mutiny of sepoys of the British East India Company's army. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to Company power in that region. The rebellion led to the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858. It also led the British to reorganize the army, the financial system and the administration in India. India was thereafter directly governed by the crown as the new British Raj. ",

It is the only surviving building from the original campus. Over its long history South Hall hosted the first physics lab in America, the business school, and a museum for the state geological survey. It now houses the newest graduate school on campus, The School of Information. South Hall is also the home of the smallest bear statue on campus.",

In the late fifties, The Regents decided to establish a general campus at San Diego with only graduate studies and degrees in the physical sciences offered at first, until the campus was open to undergraduates in 1964. Undergraduate instructions was first offered at all class levels in 1966. Other research units are concerned with geophysics and planetary physics, information systems, and developmental biology. ",

His plan to teach marine biology was to take his students to the ocean to study living creatures in their natural environment. He wanted to set up a permanent laboratory as well as a classroom along the Pacific coast. Ritter seared for eleven years for an appropriate place and spent summers at various places along the coast with students. Then in 1903 Ritter was introduced to newspaper magnate E. W. Scripps, and together with Ellen Browning Scripps, formed the Marine Biological Association of San Diego with Ritter as the Scientific Director. They arranged a purchase of La Jolla land two years later. ",

The first College of Letters and Sciences was established in 1954, and became one of the general campuses by 1959. In 1960 special training was inaugurated by the College of Agriculture, and post-graduate division was started under a Graduate Division in 1961. In 1970, the all purpose College of Letters and Sciences was dissolved and was taken by colleges of Humanities, Physical Sciences, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and a Division of Undergraduate Studies. UC Riverside perpetuated a small college atmosphere while incorporating the advantages of a major university. ",

The students remained peaceful at their sit-in at the Plaza and Mario Savio gave his famous speech on the steps of Sproul Hall. Around midnight a call for a mass arrest was made. The police arrested close to 800 students who were bussed to the Dublin Jail. They were released on their own after a few hours, but the University pressed chargers against the students who organized the sit in. Eventually the University officials backed down and established new rules for polical activities on campus. ",

It is recognized as one of the most memorable plays in college football history. After Stanford had taken the lead on a field goal with four seconds left in the game the Bears used five lateral passes on the return to score the winning touchdown and victory. Midway through the return members of the Stanford Band rushed the field believing the game was over. To this day they play sparks intense disagreement.",

Conceived by Professor Walter Alvarez and Roland Saekow and developed by the department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley in collaboration with Microsoft Research and Moscow State University, Alvarez unveiled the first ChronoZoom prototype at UC Berkeley's 2010 Faculty Research Lecture. That demo is available to the public online, and a second version rewritten in HTML5 is now available and open source in beta form. ChronoZoom was inspired by the study of Big History, and it approaches the documentation and visualization of time and history in the same way that Google Earth deals with geography.  ChronoZoom allows users to see the true scale of time over cosmic, geologic, biological and social periods.",

Scientists increasingly see their instruments through online scientific archives and analysis tools, rather than examining the raw data. Today this analysis is primarily driven by scientists asking queries, but scientific archives are becoming active databases that self-organize and recognize interesting and anomalous facts as data arrives. In some fields, data from many different archives can be cross-correlated to produce new insights. Astronomy presents an excellent example of these trends; and, federating Astronomy archives presents interesting challenges for computer scientists.",

East Asian cultures used the explanation of dragons, European cultures reasoned they were wiped out by the great flood and did not make it onto Noah's ark, and it's possible that the Aztec's god Quetzalcoatl was originally thought of to explain these mysterious findings.

It was a puzzling find for Mantell who did not immediately know what to make of such large bones and teeth but ultimately gave it the name Iguanodon because the teeth were similar to those of a very large iguana.

Most of these would have been closely related to birds and would have been in the raptor family, but increasingly it is being suggested that many other kinds of dinosaurs may have in fact had downy plumage. Especially in juvenile dinosaurs, it is thought the feathers would have kept the young warm, and in larger dinosaurs it would have fallen out. Microraptor is one discovery of a small raptor that would have acted much like a carnivorous flying squirrel, gliding from tree to tree, feeding on small prey.",

During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily while interacting with other areas such as Teotihuancán. One of the most studied sites is the North Acropolis. The North Acropolis (pictured here) developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period. Each additional royal burial added new temples and pyramids on top of the existing structure. The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the Postclassic Period. It is located in present day Guatemala; the site is part of Guatemala's Tikal National Park. \r\n",

Instead, market places imply that a free-market economy might have supplemented or co-existed with the tax and tribute system.",

The campaign began in the early 16th century but would take about 170 years until the last recognized Maya stronghold fell. One of the first contacts was in 1517 when Hernández de Córdoba sailed from Cuba in search of slaves. The Spaniards were surprised to see stone cities along the coast of the Yucatan and landed in several different cities. After Spanish dominion over the region was established the Maya people remained resistant under Spanish rule. ",

For hundreds of years the city was the cultural, religious, and trading center of the Mayan Civilization. The city is thought to have lasted until the 7th and 8th centuries. The city began to come to an end in 869 and was fully abandoned in 899. The largest pyramid, the Pyramid of the Sun, was completed by 100AD. Today, the city is considered an archaeological site that contains the largest pyramidal structures built in the pre-columbian Americas. ",

An estimated 1.2 million people visit. Covering the National Mall from the Washington Monument to the grounds of the U.S. Capital Building, The Quilt occupied an area equal to 24 football fields.\r\n\r\nPresident William J. Clinton attends the national Quilt display on the Mall, along with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. He is the first U.S. President to visit a display of The AIDS Memorial Quilt.\r\n\r\n“I remember when Hillary and I walked on the Mall to see The Quilt. It was a personally emotional thing, seeing the love and devotion that those sections of The Quilt represented for all those people who died prematurely, and knowing that now, with medicine, they didn’t have to die so fast anymore, if we did the right things. It was a very emotional day.” — President William J. Clinton",

In 1987 when the first panel of The Quilt was constructed, public officials were debating mandatory testing and mandatory quarantines of infected citizens. Homophobic reaction to HIV/AIDS was rampant. First dubbed the “Gay Plague” and the disease of drug addicts, HIV/AIDS was a companion to prejudice and ignorance. The Quilt became a unifying force both for the gay community and for society. Quilt tours became a venue for peaceful demonstration; an opportunity for all people to stand together and honor those lost to AIDS and a means to support the gay community.",

Under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the empire became the most powerful state in the world, a multinational, multilingual empire controlling much of southeast Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. For six centuries the Ottoman Empire's vast influence around the Mediterranean basin made it the centre of interaction between the Eastern and Western worlds. After its capture in 1453, Constantinople became the capital city of the Ottoman Empire until its dissolution in the 20th century.",

Through experimental archaeology, Stout works on understanding how early stone tools were made by attempting the task himself. He describes the skill, knowledge, and precision required for the making of these tools throughout history and what it tells us about the evolving brain and mind of early humans.",

Traditionally, they were viewed as slow lumbering beasts that lived near swamps to support their weight. They were also usually depicted with their necks craning and moving like those of swans. However, recent research shows that they were more capable of carrying their own weight and their necks were actually more stiff than expected. This was because their size forced them to be built like suspension bridges, with their long necks supported by their tails as counterweights.",

The climate was favorable and the continents were breaking apart, creating fertile shallow seas and many miles of coast line which improved rain patterns. These conditions allowed dinosaurs to grow to enormous sizes, as both predator and prey attempted to gain the upper hand on one another. Sauropods were the extreme example, growing to sizes sometimes of over 100 feet in length, they used their size as a deterrent against predators and to control a niche in their environment that no other creature could access. They were eating machines designed to process huge amounts of foliage. And they did so so quickly that they had not time to chew. In fact, they ate small stones so that the plant matter would get ground up within their stomach's. Apatosaurus is probably the most well known of all sauropods, but is likely known by it's older name by many which is Brontosaurus.",

It marked the end of the Paleozoic Eon and the beginning of the Mesozoic Eon and the age of the dinosaurs. The creation of the super continent Pangaea was the main cause of the extinction. When all the continents came together, thousands of miles of coastline disappeared, creating a huge inland desert that stretched from pole to pole. In addition the Siberian Traps, a huge area with large amounts of volcanic activity formed during this time, releasing massive amounts of CO2 into the air. This increase in greenhouse gases combined with the newly formed supercontinent disrupted ocean currents, causing them to stagnate, releasing millions of tons of methane and CO2 into the atmosphere, creating a feedback looped that raised temperatures by almost 12 degrees Fahrenheit, devastating all life on earth.",

They provided an efficient alliance between insects and plants in that pollination was now carried out via animals and not just the wind and water.

Thus a beautiful symbiosis emerged, and allowed an explosion of biodiversity.",

The cause is difficult to pin on a single event but we do know that these were times of environmental change and these changes are what caused the extinction. One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation. With fewer burrowing organisms and no large plant eaters at the time, these plants created large coal deposits, and in the process, they would have cooled the earth.",

In terms of the % of genera wiped out, it is the second largest, only behind the Permian-Triassic Mass Extinction.The generally accepted theory is that a large amount of CO2 was sequestered during that time and this caused a drop in global temperatures creating an ice age. We know of this because of glacial deposits in the Sahara desert. The end of the ice age saw a rise in sea levels and an increase in biodiversity among the survivors of this event",

It is the most recent and infamous for the disappearance of all non-avian dinosaurs. For years the reason behind the extinction event went unknown, until Professor Walter Alvarez discovered a layer of Iridium that suggested an asteroid impact. After many years of research and the discovery of a large crater on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, it is now well established that the demise of the dinosaurs came from outer space. The impact created a tsunami that ravaged the Atlantic coast and the heat from it caused forest fires all over the north America. The rock that was ejected from the impact flew into space rained fire back down onto the earth, making the devastation global. The event caused essentially every creature larger than 50 pounds to die out, wiping out all dinosaur species, except for birds and leaving mammals and empty world to populate.",

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of Nobel prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160 and 20 times in three sections originally studied).",

If the object is small, friction from the atmosphere will tend to vaporize it before it reaches the ground creating meteors, also known as falling stars.

They evolved during the jurassic period from small theropod dinosaurs and diversified into a hugely successful group of animals. They are characterized by being endothermic, oviparous and having feathers. It is thought that dinosaurs must have undergone a process of neoteny when evolving into birds. This means that the adult members of the species retained many traits specific to juveniles of that species. The main trait that is thought to have been passed on like this is feathers. The young dinosaurs would develop the downy feathers that characterize young birds today in order to keep warm, and over time these feathers would have evolved other uses such as for display, gliding and eventually flying.

The first were the archosaurs, a group that used to be represented by the dinosaurs, but who today only consist of birds and crocodiles. For 185 million years they ruled the earth marking the Mesozoic as the “Age of the Dinosaurs”.\r\nThe second important group of animals to arise came from small group of synapsids or mammal-like reptiles. Here we find our own origins. The first were small during the time of the dinosaurs, but once the asteroid hit, everything heavier than 50 pounds was wiped out leaving a huge vacuum of niches in the environment for mammals to grow into, allowing them to claim the Cenozoic as the “Age of Mammals”. Within a few million years, mammals had diversified into a myriad of forms, one of which was the common ancestor of all primates and human beings.\r\n",

Animals ventured onto land before plants existed on land, but did so only for a short period of their lives to possibly lay eggs. Their offspring would then spend the majority of their life in the ocean. Plants were the first organisms live their whole life on land because they developed a vascular system where they could retain water. Animals needed more time to develop and also needed plants to create an ecosystem that was hospitable. ",

Buried under Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, the 180 km-wide crater is one of the largest and most studied impact structures on Earth.

First postulated by Luis and Walter Alvarez at the University of California, Berkeley, the theory has since been supported by extensive paleontological, geophysical/chemical, and climatological data, and is now widely accepted in the scientific community.

The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the highest known mountain within the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.",

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined what it means to be a \"planet\" within the Solar System: 1) the oject must be in orbit around the Sun; 2) the object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force; and 3) it must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto fails to meet the third condition, since its mass in only 0.07 times that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit. Pluto was then reclassified as a \"dwarf planet\".",

Elements are presented in increasing atomic number; while rectangular in general outline, gaps are included in the rows or periods to keep elements with similar properties together. For example, the halogens and the noble gases are in columns or groups, forming distinct rectangular areas or blocks. Because the periodic table accurately predicts the properties of various elements and the relations between properties, its use is widespread within chemistry, providing a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, as well as in other sciences. Although precursors exist, the current table is generally credited to Dmitri Mendeleev, who developed it in 1869 to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements; the layout has been refined and extended as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models developed to explain chemical behavior.",

It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater.

His work was based off of Pardies and Doppelmayr, and depicts the Northern night sky between the months of July and September. It includes the Zodiac signs Scorpio (the Scorpion), Sagittarius (the Archer), Capricorn (the Goat), Serpentarins (the Serpent Bearer) and Taurus (the Bull). The Zodiac refers to the thin band along the ecliptic composed of the Zodiac signs and constellations. The zodiac is divided into twelve different signs each of which is 30 degrees long. It is believed that the concept of the zodiac evolved from Babylonian astronomy, and was later influenced by Hellenistic astronomy.",

The \"Big Crunch\", Ω>1 on the graph, hypothesized a universe dominated by matter in which gravity will eventually overcome the expanding forces of the Universe. This Universe would end similarly to the Big Bang, in a Big Crunch in which everything would once more come together. Other predictions envisioned a universe that would gradually slow down in its acceleration, or continue steadily at the same rate. However, with the discovery of dark energy as the dominating force in the Universe, it was discovered that the Universe is actually accelerating in its expansion.",

He was the first person to propose the theory of the expansion of the Universe, widely misattributed to Edwin Hubble. He was also the first to derive what is now known as Hubble's law and made the first estimation of what is now called the Hubble constant which he published in 1927, two years before Hubble's article. Lemaître also proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, which he called his 'hypothesis of the primeval atom'.",
