Called highly active\r\nanti-retroviral therapy or HAART, the treatment can cut HIV viral load to\r\nundetectable levels.  Hope surges when AIDS researcher David Ho, MD, suggests\r\ntreatment could eliminate HIV from the body.  He's wrong -- it's later found that\r\nHIV hides in dormant cells.  In one year, deaths from AIDS in the US decline by more\r\nthan 40%.",
