Called highly active\r\nanti-retroviral therapy or HAART, the treatment can cut HIV viral load to\r\nundetectable levels.  Hope surges when AIDS researcher David Ho, MD, suggests\r\ntreatment could eliminate HIV from the body.  He's wrong -- it's later found that\r\nHIV hides in dormant cells.  In one year, deaths from AIDS in the US decline by more\r\nthan 40%.",

                            "description" : "In March, 100 new Quilt panels are begun in Atlanta in conjunction with the National Week of Prayer for the Healing of AIDS — seven panelmaking workshops are held in seven days. These workshops are a part of the “Call My Name” panelmaking program, that invites communities of color to create new panels to memorialize loved ones lost to AIDS.\r\n\r\nAs part of this commemoration, Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Senior Pastor of Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, takes an HIV/AIDS test during the Sunday morning service to encourage members to do the same. \r\n\r\n“We don’t like to talk about these things in church. We’ve got to fight the unholy trinity of silence, shame and stigma.” As Reverend Warnock makes these remarks, he stands in front of four blocks of The Quilt.",
