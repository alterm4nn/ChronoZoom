In the late 1970s, following the discovery of other minor planets in the outer Solar System and the recognition of Pluto's relatively low mass, its status as a major planet began to be questiond. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined what it means to be a \"planet\" within the Solar System: 1) the oject must be in orbit around the Sun; 2) the object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force; and 3) it must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto fails to meet the third condition, since its mass in only 0.07 times that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit. Pluto was then reclassified as a \"dwarf planet\".",

Because the periodic table accurately predicts the properties of various elements and the relations between properties, its use is widespread within chemistry, providing a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, as well as in other sciences. Although precursors exist, the current table is generally credited to Dmitri Mendeleev, who developed it in 1869 to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements; the layout has been refined and extended as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models developed to explain chemical behavior.",

It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater.

This Universe would end similarly to the Big Bang, in a Big Crunch in which everything would once more come together. Other predictions envisioned a universe that would gradually slow down in its acceleration, or continue steadily at the same rate. However, with the discovery of dark energy as the dominating force in the Universe, it was discovered that the Universe is actually accelerating in its expansion.",

He was the first person to propose the theory of the expansion of the Universe, widely misattributed to Edwin Hubble. He was also the first to derive what is now known as Hubble's law and made the first estimation of what is now called the Hubble constant which he published in 1927, two years before Hubble's article. Lemaître also proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, which he called his 'hypothesis of the primeval atom'.",

It is hypothesized that they have similar origins to mitochondria in that they were originally free living cyanobacteria that were ingested and later evolved within larger eukaryotic cells as endosymbionts. The function of chloroplasts is to generate organic molecules, especially simple sugars such as glucose, from CO2 and H2O. This is an extremely important function ecologically since it recycles inorganic molecules and creates molecules we can gain sustenance from by using solar energy. It carries out its functions through thylakoids and has two sets of reactions: light dependent which use chlorophyll A and B to break down water and create oxygen, and light independent (or Calvin cycle) which actually create the simple sugars and fixes carbon dioxide.",

The phospholipid bilayer on its own would not be enough to maintain the integrity of the cell so microtubules and microfilaments made of tubulin and actin protein polymers respectively create a network that keep cells shape. In fact these same proteins are what allow for many types of cellular locomotion such as pseudopod motion. Many proteins move across these tubes and filaments in order to move objects accurately to their destination. In animal cells, structures known as centrosomes made up of these tubes help guide mitosis, or cellular division. ",

The energy it generates comes from breaking high energy bonds in organic molecules, which is released when these molecules form new low energy bonds as CO2 and H2O. The mitochondria uses that differential to generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The basic breakdown of glucose occurs in three steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis actually takes place outside of the mitochondria and involves the splitting of the glucose molecule in half. These halves then move into the mitochondria into the Citric Acid cycle. There the complete breakdown occurs. Finally all these electron carrier molecules pass through ATP synthase and for a total of around 32 ATP per glucose molecule. It is thought mitochondria originally were separate organisms that evolved inside eukaryotic cells and are now endosymbionts.",

It is what you would call a ribozyme since it is an enzyme (protein) and a ribonucelotide. The way translation occurs is that the mRNA is fed through the ribosome and this ribosome reads it, three letters at a time. There are 64 different combinations, but only 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, so some amino acids have several three letter codes. As these codes are read, tRNAs with complimentary three letter sequences and one amino acid bound to them enter the ribosome from the top and begin assembling a chain of amino acids that will later become a protein.",

Most DNA is not actually genes that code for something important, but rather junk DNA that is there to absorb damage and protect the genes from damage, and then most genes aren't expressed in every cell, only a small subset are.

Around 600 million years ago, the world was thrust into this ice age because much of the CO2 in the atmosphere was sequestered by plankton and taken out of the carbon cycle by being deposited as limestone. This reduction in greenhouse gases caused temperatures to plummet to an extraordinary degree, causing a global winter that only subsided after enough CO2 had been returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes.

This made them more prone to genetic diseases and if there was a harmful mutation in a vital gene, they would perish. When sexual reproduction appeared, organisms became more resilient because they had two sets of genes and became what is known as diploid. That is why we humans have 46 chromosomes, but we say we have 23 pairs. This allows for interesting mixes in recessives and dominants to allow for more variation and natural selection. The alternation of generations concept is that some organisms live part of their life cycle as haploids and part as diploids. Though we humans only have a short haploid phase as sperm and eggs, some fungi live mostly in a haploid state, while more primitive plants can be half in half living as sporophytes (diploid) or gametophytes (haploid).",

Though we do acquire energy when we consume them and we need them to survive, the actual source of energy for our bodies is a molecule called Adenosine Triphosphate, abbreviated as ATP. It is the universal molecule that cells use as an energy source to carry out its functions. What make's ATP so energetically charged is the fact that it has three very negatively charged phosphate groups bound very closely to one another. This repelling force held so closely together allows ATP to transmit it's energy to other systems by \"phosphorylating\" them. Essentially what this means is that some of that stored energy can be passed on to another system (such as an enzyme) by giving one of it's phosphate groups to it. To restore itself to ATP it needs to break down a complex molecule, continuing the cycle.",

Cells will use oxygen's high reactivity to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, and using the energy that process releases to carry their own cellular functions. The simplest version of this is the breakdown of glucose, the product of photosynthesis. It takes place in 3 steps main steps, the first where the glucose is split in half into two pyruvates. The second, or Krebb's Cycle, is where the pyruvates are broken down and used to produce a lot of NADHs, a carrier molecule.

This is because this is the lowest energy state they can be in, and is the basis for a concept known as electronegativity. An element is electronegative if it will try to gain electrons and an electropositive one will try to get rid of them. Oxygen is a good oxidizer, meaning it is good at accepting electrons because it is very electronegative. This makes it very reactive and capable of bonding with many different compounds.

How this works on a molecular level is that plants use photons from the Sun (in the blue and red part of the spectrum, reflecting green back which is what we see) to break the bonds in water and CO2, and form new, higher energy bonds as sugars and they use chlorophyll as a pigment to do this. This sugars can then be broken down to create energy as ATP to power the production of other organic molecules, or used to build cell walls as cellulose, or stored as starch. As animals eat plants and the energy moves up the food chain, these high energy bonds move up as well, meaning we all run on solar power.",

However, not all the changes were good, the corrosive nature of oxygen meant that a lot of organisms were either damaged by it or the chemicals they utilized for metabolism disappeared or were confined to niche extreme environments. It also oxidize methane, a greenhouse gas, leaving Earth fell into a large ice age known as the “Snowball Earth” period",

Amino acids follow a simple core structure. There is a central carbon bonded to a hydrogen atom on top, an amine group to the left, a carboxylic acid group to the right and then a variable radical group on the bottom. This radical group can be anything and it is the one variable part in amino acids. Though there is virtually an infinite number of radicals that can be attached, the most amazing part about life is that all proteins come from 20 different radicals... Total.

He majored in ceramics in college and began making primitive items with native clays. Knapping is the shaping of flint, chert, obsidian or other conchoidally-fracturing stone. Knapping is used to manufacture stone tools, strikers, or flat-faced stones for building or facing walls. In cultures that have not adopted metalworking technologies, the production of stone tools by knappers is common.",

However Ostia’s harbour was too small to admit large ships like those which carried grain, an essential import for the populous capital. Large ships either had to dock further out and have smaller ships unload their cargo piecemeal or dock into the harbour at Pozzuoli and have the cargo unloaded and then taken overland to Rome. \r\nSuetonius notes (Diuus Claudius XX.1) that the creation of a large harbour to accommodate these ships was considered and then abandoned by Julius Caesar in the first century BC as too difficult an undertaking. Despite the enormity of the project and its substantial cost, Claudius initiated the construction of the large artificial harbour on the north side of the Tiber mouth in AD 42.",

Also Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia IX.5.14-15) relates the story of Claudius trapping a killer whale at Portus by closing off the mouth of the harbour with nets and then engaging it in combat.",

AD 110, Portus was expanded by the emperor Trajan (Pliny the Younger, Panegyricus XXIX.2). A new hexagonal harbour basin was excavated inland behind the Claudian basin and associated infrastructure was constructed around it including warehouses, a possible ship shed, a temple and an expansive and lavishly decorated administrative building which was later dubbed the Palazzo Imperiale. At least one canal, mentioned by Pliny (Epistulae VIII.17.1-2) and possibly also referred to in a fragmentary inscription (CIL XIV 88 = CIL VI 964), was created by Trajan as well. The inauguration of Trajan’s work at Portus was commemorated with a coin issue displaying a bird’s eye view of the hexagonal harbour on the reverse.",

A bishop from the ‘Portus Romae’ is mentioned as having attended the Council of Arles in AD 314. In a letter written in AD 398, Saint Jerome (Epistulae LXXVII.10.1-3) refers to the establishment of a hostel at Portus to provide hospitality for Christians travellers. South of the mouth of the Trajanic harbour basin, an early form of a Christian basilica (consisting of a nave demarcated from the flanking aisles with a row of eight columns) is built in the mid-fourth century AD with further additions and renovations undertaken at the end of the fourth century through to the sixth century AD.",

General Belisarius reclaimed Rome from the Ostrogoths in AD 536 with the support of the city’s people. The Ostrogoths, led by Vittigis, made to take back the city. In AD 537, they seized Portus and, now having Rome’s crucial supply link in their possession, the Ostrogoths then besieged Rome (Procopius, History of the Wars of Justinian V.26.3-19). The siege lasted a year and resulted in disease and famine for both sides since although the Ostrogoths held Portus, the Byzantines had control of the seas. Suffering from lack of supplies, Vittigis ordered the Ostrogoths to abandon Portus which was then immediately occupied by the Isaurians (Procopius, History of the Wars of Justinian VI.7).",

The weapon was preferably made from the yew tree, but other wood could be used as well. It was considered the most effective conventional weapon on the battlefield due to its flexibility and length. The jang chang was widely used in the battle to retake the Pyong-yang Fortress during the 1592 war between Chosun (Korea) and Japan. ",

Soldiers learned gwonbeop prior to learning more complex weapons arts to master footwork and body control. It was also taught as a method of personal self-defense for Joseon warriors. Quan fa is a generic term used for open handed Chinese martial arts. Gwonbeop was developed based on the methods of the Shaolin Temple and the techniques of Jang Song Gye (장송계 hanja: 張松溪). The hanja for quan fa and gwonbeop are the same. The chapter in the muyedobotongji dealing with gwonbeop was inspired by Chinese writings describing quan fa-techniques. It was the Chinese general Qi Jiguang who said that empty-handed fighting methods were impractical on the battlefield.",

It was so named because of its curved blade. The Muyedobotongji describes its design: “The length of the handle is six feet, four inches; the length of the blade is two feet, eight inches; and the weight is three pounds, 15 ounces.” It usually had a spike on the end of the handle, and a feather or tassel attached by a ring to the back of the blade.

The Gaehwapa (Enlightenment Party) group of reformers sought to initiate rapid changes within Korea to open its borders. Thwarted by conservative factions within the Joseon court, particularly the pro-Chinese Sugup'a, they launched a coup d'état attempt with Japanese support, seizing the royal palace in Seoul. Facing this threat, Queen Min secretly requested Qing military intervention, and after three days, the revolt was suppressed by 1500 troops of the Qing garrison led by General Yuan Shikai.",

The coup was aborted in three days, as China intervened by sending military troops. Convicted of treason, Seo Jae-Pil lost his whole family and had to flee Korea for the United States to save his life. In 1894, Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese war which occurred in the Korean Peninsula, and the Korean cabinet was filled with reformists who pardoned Jaisohn enabling his return in 1895. In Korea, he endeavored to politically educate people. He published The Independent to transform Korean people into an informed citizenry.",

It constituted two different language editions: Korean and English. Originally, it was published every other day, but it developed into a daily newspaper in Korean with an estimated average circulation of between two and three thousand copies. The Tongnip Sinmun was historic in terms of its contribution to, and impact on Korean political and intellectual history, generally raising awareness despite a corrupt government that eventually forced its demise. It was the first newspaper printed entirely in Korean, extending readership to lower classes and women. ",

Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin is credited with designing the ship. His turtle ships were equipped with at least five different types of cannons. Their most distinguishable feature was a dragon-shaped head at the bow (front) that could launch cannon fire or flames from the mouth. Each was also equipped with a fully covered deck to deflect arrow fire, musket-shots, and incendiary weapons. The deck was covered with iron spikes to discourage enemy men from attempting to board the ship. Claims that it was iron plated remain controversial.",

Like other Korean Confucian academies, Dosan Seowon serves two purposes: education and commemoration. The site was well known in Korea as one of the leading academies and was home to the Toegye School of Thought for over 400 years. Although the educational function of the facility has long since ceased, the commemorative ceremonies have been and are still held twice a year.",

During the reign of a king, professional historiographers maintained extensive records on national affairs and the activities of the state. Great care was taken to ensure the neutrality of the historiographers, who were also officials with legal guarantees of independence. Nobody was allowed to read the Sacho, not even the king, and any historiographer who disclosed its contents or changed the content could be punished with beheading. These strict regulations lend great credibility to these records.",

From his observations, Kepler elucidated three laws that describe the motions of celestial bodies in orbit, such as planets around the Sun. Kepler's laws are: 1. The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. 2. A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. 3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. ",

He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\" by a newspaper reporter, he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large teamwork to the process of invention, and therefore is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. He is also the fourth most prolific inventor in history, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. ",

It generalizes Galileo's principle of relativity—that all uniform motion is relative, and that there is no absolute and well-defined state of rest (no privileged reference frames)—from mechanics to all the laws of physics, including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics. Special relativity incorporates the principle that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers regardless of the state of motion of the source.",

In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the four-momentum (mass-energy and linear momentum) of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.",

The pendulum clock, and the other innovations that accompanied it thereafter, allowed for the production of clocks that were cheaper and more accurate. For the first time, people outside the aristocracy and royalty could afford to own clocks and even more importantly pocket watches, which allowed for personalized timekeeping. Prior to Huygens, clocks could not be relied on for accuracy beyond an expected error of 15 minutes per day. The pendulum helped reduce that margin of error to about 10-15 seconds.",

In 1748, Franklin wrote \"Advice to a Young Tradesman,\" which recommended that one should “remember that time is money.” Franklin described the meaning of this proverb by comparing a man's earnings for an entire day's work to the earnings of a man who idles half the day. “Though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness,” Franklin explained, “he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.” Because one can earn wages from an hour's work, an hour wasted is the equivalent of losing those same wages in addition to the money that was spent during such leisure time.",

Smiles' most famous work, Self-Help, represents a great many beliefs at the heart of British cultural identity. This identity included a belief in the phrase \"time is money.\" Smiles advised that time should be “employed in good works.” If hours of indolence were put to proper use, they would “make an ignorant man wise in a few years.”",

The character of Oliver Fearnleaf could “see many compensations arising from the absence of a watch” given that the “sights, shapes and sounds” could be his time markers “and the whole world was [his] clock.” Waugh imagined Fearnleaf finding that his watch had swallowed up “a good deal of pocket money” in maintenance costs. The watch became “a continual source of anxiety” and so Fearnleaf got rid of it. This suggests an attitude towards timekeeping that may not have been obvious to those writing about an apparently self-evident need for time reform. Waugh does ascribe one significant inconvenience to lacking an accurate watch: Oliver Fearnleaf always misses the train...",

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 began as a mutiny of sepoys of the British East India Company's army. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to Company power in that region. The rebellion led to the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858. It also led the British to reorganize the army, the financial system and the administration in India.

A woman is shown turning a roller to separate cotton fibers or lint from the seeds. WIthout the invention of Eli Whitney's cotton gin, this tedious separation process would otherwise be performed painstakingly by hand.

British Parliament banned the importation of cheaper cotton textiles from India, where plentiful cotton was grown by slave labor. This ban increased incentive for innovation by British textile producers. ",

The Newcomen engine featured only a single chamber, into which jets of steam and cold water were alternately injected. This cycle of heating and cooling proved to be inefficient, and much of the steam potential was lost. Watt created a separate condensation chamber connected to the main chamber. Cold water was injected only into the condenser, allowing for condensation without significant heat loss and far greater fuel efficiency than the Newcomen engine.",

The Great Stink, or the Big Stink, was a time in the summer of 1858 which the smell of untreated human waste was very strong in central London. Until the late 16th century London citizens relied on water from shallow wells, the River Thames, its tributaries, or natural springs so the water was not abstracted for unauthorised commercial or industrial purposes. For seven years human waste was dumped into the Thames and then potentially pumped back to the same households for drinking, cooking and bathing. ",

Maritime trade between England and China began in the 17th century. However, there was a far greater European demand for Chinese goods, such as tea, silk, and porcelain, and little Chinese interest in European goods. As a result, Chinese goods were paid for in silver. In an attempt to stem and reverse the vast flow of silver out of Britain, the East India Company began to sell the addictive and mass-appealing effects of Indian-produced opium to Chinese dealers, in exchange for silver. Recognizing the effects of addiction in its population, Chinese leaders placed bans on opium save in small amounts for medicinal purposes. However, opium continued to be smuggled into and sold in China in the mid-19th century, where tensions culminated in the First and Second Opium Wars.",

Carnegie Steel Company was a steel producing company created by Andrew Carnegie to manage business at his steel mills in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area in the late 19th century.

Carnegie installed improved systems that greatly sped up the process of steelmaking and allowed the production of far vaster quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force (especially the less skilled workers) also grew rapidly. ",

The revolutions were initiated by French citizens, in protest of terrible work conditions, pitiful incomes, and the conservative turn of the French Second Republic. The National Guard was called in to suppress the protests, resulting in violent struggles and many thousands of deaths and injuries. The revolution ended in failure after the insurgents were crushed by the authorities. However, as a result, a new constitution was established, stating that a president was to be elected by the people every four years. Upon enactment of the constitution, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte was elected into office in December 1848.",

He is shown wearing the cap and greatcoat of the Imperial Horse-Guards Regiment. Alexander II is also known as Alexander the Liberator. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to end a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia, and as a result emancipation committees were formed. The Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. ",

His plan to teach marine biology was to take his students to the ocean to study living creatures in their natural environment. He wanted to set up a permanent laboratory as well as a classroom along the Pacific coast. Ritter seared for eleven years for an appropriate place and spent summers at various places along the coast with students. Then in 1903 Ritter was introduced to newspaper magnate E. W. Scripps, and together with Ellen Browning Scripps, formed the Marine Biological Association of San Diego with Ritter as the Scientific Director. They arranged a purchase of La Jolla land two years later. ",

The students remained peaceful at their sit-in at the Plaza and Mario Savio gave his famous speech on the steps of Sproul Hall. Around midnight a call for a mass arrest was made. The police arrested close to 800 students who were bussed to the Dublin Jail. They were released on their own after a few hours, but the University pressed chargers against the students who organized the sit in. Eventually the University officials backed down and established new rules for polical activities on campus. ",

It is recognized as one of the most memorable plays in college football history. After Stanford had taken the lead on a field goal with four seconds left in the game the Bears used five lateral passes on the return to score the winning touchdown and victory. Midway through the return members of the Stanford Band rushed the field believing the game was over. To this day they play sparks intense disagreement.",

Conceived by Professor Walter Alvarez and Roland Saekow and developed by the department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley in collaboration with Microsoft Research and Moscow State University, Alvarez unveiled the first ChronoZoom prototype at UC Berkeley's 2010 Faculty Research Lecture. That demo is available to the public online, and a second version rewritten in HTML5 is now available and open source in beta form. ChronoZoom was inspired by the study of Big History, and it approaches the documentation and visualization of time and history in the same way that Google Earth deals with geography.  ChronoZoom allows users to see the true scale of time over cosmic, geologic, biological and social periods.",

The ancestral traits of dinosaurs have also been found within their DNA. However, some still scoff at the idea of a chickenosaurus.",

During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily while interacting with other areas such as Teotihuancán. One of the most studied sites is the North Acropolis. The North Acropolis (pictured here) developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period. Each additional royal burial added new temples and pyramids on top of the existing structure. The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the Postclassic Period. It is located in present day Guatemala; the site is part of Guatemala's Tikal National Park. \r\n",

It has been described as one of the greatest of all archaeological sites in the New World, although its remains today are far less impressive. It was comprised of some 200 platforms and pyramidal mounds, half of which were created before the end of the Preclassic period.",

This means that the adult members of the species retained many traits specific to juveniles of that species. The main trait that is thought to have been passed on like this is feathers. The young dinosaurs would develop the downy feathers that characterize young birds today in order to keep warm, and over time these feathers would have evolved other uses such as for display, gliding and eventually flying.

Animals ventured onto land before plants existed on land, but did so only for a short period of their lives to possibly lay eggs.

Plants were the first organisms live their whole life on land because they developed a vascular system where they could retain water.

The climate was favorable and the continents were breaking apart, creating fertile shallow seas and many miles of coast line which improved rain patterns. These conditions allowed dinosaurs to grow to enormous sizes, as both predator and prey attempted to gain the upper hand on one another. Sauropods were the extreme example, growing to sizes sometimes of over 100 feet in length, they used their size as a deterrent against predators and to control a niche in their environment that no other creature could access. They were eating machines designed to process huge amounts of foliage. And they did so so quickly that they had not time to chew. In fact, they ate small stones so that the plant matter would get ground up within their stomach's. Apatosaurus is probably the most well known of all sauropods, but is likely known by it's older name by many which is Brontosaurus.",

The cause is difficult to pin on a single event but we do know that these were times of environmental change and these changes are what caused the extinction. One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation. With fewer burrowing organisms and no large plant eaters at the time, these plants created large coal deposits, and in the process, they would have cooled the earth.",

In terms of the % of genera wiped out, it is the second largest, only behind the Permian-Triassic Mass Extinction.The generally accepted theory is that a large amount of CO2 was sequestered during that time and this caused a drop in global temperatures creating an ice age.

It is the most recent and infamous for the disappearance of all non-avian dinosaurs. For years the reason behind the extinction event went unknown, until Professor Walter Alvarez discovered a layer of Iridium that suggested an asteroid impact. After many years of research and the discovery of a large crater on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, it is now well established that the demise of the dinosaurs came from outer space. The impact created a tsunami that ravaged the Atlantic coast and the heat from it caused forest fires all over the north America. The rock that was ejected from the impact flew into space rained fire back down onto the earth, making the devastation global. The event caused essentially every creature larger than 50 pounds to die out, wiping out all dinosaur species, except for birds and leaving mammals and empty world to populate.",

It was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of Nobel prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160 and 20 times in three sections originally studied).",

This is because the equation for kinetic energy depends on the mass of the object and the square of its speed. Because the Earth's gravity does a lot to speed up the asteroid, it can reach speeds of several kilometers per second. If the object is small, friction from the atmosphere will tend to vaporize it before it reaches the ground creating meteors, also known as falling stars. But if the object is large, there isn't much that can slow it down and when it collides with earth it unleashes a lot of devastation. The one that wiped out the dinosaurs is thought to have been between 6 and 9 miles long.",

Buried under Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, the 180 km-wide crater is one of the largest and most studied impact structures on Earth. Dated to about 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub crater lends strong evidence to the theory that a violent impact caused the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event, which is most noted for wiping out the dinosaurs. First postulated by Luis and Walter Alvarez at the University of California, Berkeley, the theory has since been supported by extensive paleontological, geophysical/chemical, and climatological data, and is now widely accepted in the scientific community.

The region’s soil, also rich in minerals, is among the most fertile land in Northern Ontario.",
