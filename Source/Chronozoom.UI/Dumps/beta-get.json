                "description" : "In Part 2, you’ll learn how gravity causes temperatures to increase radically, triggering the process of fusion that creates stars. You’ll explore why this is regarded as a major threshold of increasing complexity. Stars became the first complex, stable entities in the Universe, with the capacity to generate energy for millions or billions of years. You'll explore how stars were produced from the simple matter permeating the early universe and discover how stars gathered together to form galaxies, clusters and superclusters. The creation of stars illustrates how the right 'Goldilocks Conditions' enabled entirely new things to appear. ",

They are very dense; a white dwarf's mass is comparable to that of the Sun and its volume is comparable to that of the Earth. Its faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of all stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star—over 97% of the stars in our galaxy. This is an image of Sirius A and Sirius B captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Sirius B, which is a white dwarf, can be seen as a faint pinprick of light to the lower left of the much brighter Sirius A.",

His work was based off of Pardies and Doppelmayr, and depicts the Northern night sky between the months of July and September. It includes the Zodiac signs Scorpio (the Scorpion), Sagittarius (the Archer), Capricorn (the Goat), Serpentarins (the Serpent Bearer) and Taurus (the Bull). The Zodiac refers to the thin band along the ecliptic composed of the Zodiac signs and constellations. The zodiac is divided into twelve different signs each of which is 30 degrees long. It is believed that the concept of the zodiac evolved from Babylonian astronomy, and was later influenced by Hellenistic astronomy.",

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater. This is a drawing of a black hole depicting the accretion lines.",

This core will suddenly collapse releasing a burst of inverse beta decay, or electron capture. The shock wave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae are so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. Most of the matter in the star is blown away by the supernova explosion and what remains will be a neutron star (which sometimes manifests itself as a pulsar or X-ray burster) or, in the case of the largest stars (large enough to leave a stellar remnant greater than roughly 4 solar masses), a black hole.",

In the late 1970s, following the discovery of other minor planets in the outer Solar System and the recognition of Pluto's relatively low mass, its status as a major planet began to be questiond. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined what it means to be a \"planet\" within the Solar System: 1) the oject must be in orbit around the Sun; 2) the object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force; and 3) it must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto fails to meet the third condition, since its mass in only 0.07 times that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit. Pluto was then reclassified as a \"dwarf planet\".",

The CMB was first discovered in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. CMB is the radiation left over from an early stage in the universe's development and is considered a landmark test of the Big Bang model of the universe. ",

Elements are presented in increasing atomic number; while rectangular in general outline, gaps are included in the rows or periods to keep elements with similar properties together. For example, the halogens and the noble gases are in columns or groups, forming distinct rectangular areas or blocks. Because the periodic table accurately predicts the properties of various elements and the relations between properties, its use is widespread within chemistry, providing a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, as well as in other sciences. Although precursors exist, the current table is generally credited to Dmitri Mendeleev, who developed it in 1869 to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements; the layout has been refined and extended as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models developed to explain chemical behavior.",

Buried under Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, the 180 km-wide crater is one of the largest and most studied impact structures on Earth. Dated to about 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub crater lends strong evidence to the theory that a violent impact caused the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event, which is most noted for wiping out the dinosaurs. First postulated by Luis and Walter Alvarez at the University of California, Berkeley, the theory has since been supported by extensive paleontological, geophysical/chemical, and climatological data, and is now widely accepted in the scientific community.

Around 600 million years ago, the world was thrust into this ice age because much of the CO2 in the atmosphere was sequestered by plankton and taken out of the carbon cycle by being deposited as limestone. This reduction in greenhouse gases caused temperatures to plummet to an extraordinary degree, causing a global winter that only subsided after enough CO2 had been returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes. It is thought that this pressure on life around at the time sped up evolution and created the more resilient body plans that we see today.",

They also have a tail which is made up of a long chain of hydrocarbons making it non-polar. This means it is similar chemically to oily substances and has a difficult time dissolving in water. This makes it hydrophobic and avoid water. When millions of these molecules are put together, they create membranes that have two layers of these lipids, with the heads facing outward toward the water, and the tails facing inward towards each other avoiding the water. They can hold themselves together fairly well because of these inter-molecular forces but are also slightly permeable to water which allows for osmosis to take place.",

The nuclear envelope is a double lipid bilayer that likely originated from an infolding of the cells normal membrane meaning the nuclear membrane is twice as thick as the regular cell membrane. Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA. Most DNA is not actually genes that code for something important, but rather junk DNA that is there to absorb damage and protect the genes from damage, and then most genes aren't expressed in every cell, only a small subset are.

It is what you would call a ribozyme since it is an enzyme (protein) and a ribonucelotide. The way translation occurs is that the mRNA is fed through the ribosome and this ribosome reads it, three letters at a time. There are 64 different combinations, but only 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, so some amino acids have several three letter codes. As these codes are read, tRNAs with complimentary three letter sequences and one amino acid bound to them enter the ribosome from the top and begin assembling a chain of amino acids that will later become a protein.",

In fact these same proteins are what allow for many types of cellular locomotion such as pseudopod motion.

The energy it generates comes from breaking high energy bonds in organic molecules, which is released when these molecules form new low energy bonds as CO2 and H2O. The mitochondria uses that differential to generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The basic breakdown of glucose occurs in three steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis actually takes place outside of the mitochondria and involves the splitting of the glucose molecule in half. These halves then move into the mitochondria into the Citric Acid cycle. There the complete breakdown occurs. Finally all these electron carrier molecules pass through ATP synthase and for a total of around 32 ATP per glucose molecule. It is thought mitochondria originally were separate organisms that evolved inside eukaryotic cells and are now endosymbionts.",

In addition, what separates higher animals from cnidarians is that all cnidarians have radial symmetry (meaning they can be cut into mirror images many different ways whereas things like humans only have one plane of symmetry or left and right sides). They also only have two germ layers from which all other cells originate whereas higher animals have 3 layers. They can be distinguished into medusas if their mouth cavity points down or polyps if it points up.  Some coral are unique and create large colonies that leave huge limestone deposits behind creating the vast reefs we see on tropical islands.

Previously organisms were haploid, meaning they had one set of genes and that was it. This made them more prone to genetic diseases and if there was a harmful mutation in a vital gene, they would perish. When sexual reproduction appeared, organisms became more resilient because they had two sets of genes and became what is known as diploid. That is why we humans have 46 chromosomes, but we say we have 23 pairs. This allows for interesting mixes in recessives and dominants to allow for more variation and natural selection. The alternation of generations concept is that some organisms live part of their life cycle as haploids and part as diploids. Though we humans only have a short haploid phase as sperm and eggs, some fungi live mostly in a haploid state, while more primitive plants can be half in half living as sporophytes (diploid) or gametophytes (haploid).",

Many organisms from this period pertain to unknown or extinct lineages; they do not have modern descendants. Most were simple, soft and tubular organisms. Somewhere within this timeframe, all the modern lineages must have appeared and then suddenly diversified during the Cambrian explosion. The first true organs were developed somewhere during this time and can be found in flatworms and higher. They consist of parenchyma tissue which is the main component and stroma which differ but connect the organ to other systems.The development of true organs, rather than just specialized tissues is what ultimately kicked evolution into overdrive and is what makes the Phanaerozoic so full of macroscopic life",

Most elements want to be like Noble Gases (elements in the column of helium), which are non-reactive. This is because this is the lowest energy state they can be in, and is the basis for a concept known as electronegativity. An element is electronegative if it will try to gain electrons and an electropositive one will try to get rid of them. Oxygen is a good oxidizer, meaning it is good at accepting electrons because it is very electronegative. This makes it very reactive and capable of bonding with many different compounds. This makes it good for breaking down complex compounds and harnessing a lot of energy from them, allowing for much more chemistry and biological properties.",

Granted there are several exceptions to this rule since there are bacteria that exist in the deep places of the earth that form the basis of food chains without the need for sun, through a process called chemiosynthesis. But for the most part, life depends on the Sun for energy. How this works on a molecular level is that plants use photons from the Sun (in the blue and red part of the spectrum, reflecting green back which is what we see) to break the bonds in water and CO2, and form new, higher energy bonds as sugars and they use chlorophyll as a pigment to do this. This sugars can then be broken down to create energy as ATP to power the production of other organic molecules, or used to build cell walls as cellulose, or stored as starch. As animals eat plants and the energy moves up the food chain, these high energy bonds move up as well, meaning we all run on solar power.",

It is the universal molecule that cells use as an energy source to carry out its functions. What make's ATP so energetically charged is the fact that it has three very negatively charged phosphate groups bound very closely to one another. This repelling force held so closely together allows ATP to transmit it's energy to other systems by \"phosphorylating\" them. Essentially what this means is that some of that stored energy can be passed on to another system (such as an enzyme) by giving one of it's phosphate groups to it.

A variety of traits make it a good element to bond with and to create long polymers such as its ability to make 4 bonds, its ability to make stronger double and triple bonds, hybridized orbitals (where structures are stabilized and can transfer energy through electron resonance), and it's ability to hold positive or negative charges under different conditions depending on the bond needed to be made. This versatility is seen as it transforms through the environment as inorganic gaseous CO2 into organic sugars, fats and amino acids and then back into CO2. It can be subducted under the Earth's crust and then released by volcanoes as gas. It can even be dissolved in the oceans and act as a buffer against pH changes as bicarbonate. Without this cycle, life would go extinct very quickly, since carbon would accumulate in some form or another.",

It can absorb a lot of energy without raising its temperature much, allowing heat from chemical reactions to dissipate. It is a polar molecule: the oxygen holds the electron's slightly closer to itself than the hydrogens do placing a slight negative charge on the oxygen and a positive charge on the hydrogen. This has many implications for its ability to dissolve ions, needed in metabolism and homeostasis, as well as other polar molecules, allowing cell membranes to form. This polarity is also involved in how ice is structured, making water's solid state less dense than its liquid state, meaning that ice will float above oceans, insulating them rather than having them freeze from the bottom up.",

They had no jaws, they were small, and they were at the bottom of the food chain. They did however carry the blueprint for all vertebrates alive today and possessed some of the basic features present in modern vertebrates such as a dorsal nerve chord, a post-anal tail, pharyngial gill slits and basic brains. Over time, they slowly grew in size and diversified into all the forms that we see today.",

The cause is difficult to pin on a single event but we do know that these were times of environmental change and these changes are what caused the extinction. One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation. With fewer burrowing organisms and no large plant eaters at the time, these plants created large coal deposits, and in the process, they would have cooled the earth.",

It marked the end of the Paleozoic Eon and the beginning of the Mesozoic Eon and the age of the dinosaurs. The creation of the super continent Pangaea was the main cause of the extinction. When all the continents came together, thousands of miles of coastline disappeared, creating a huge inland desert that stretched from pole to pole. In addition the Siberian Traps, a huge area with large amounts of volcanic activity formed during this time, releasing massive amounts of CO2 into the air. This increase in greenhouse gases combined with the newly formed supercontinent disrupted ocean currents, causing them to stagnate, releasing millions of tons of methane and CO2 into the atmosphere, creating a feedback looped that raised temperatures by almost 12 degrees Fahrenheit, devastating all life on earth.",

It coincides with the break up of Pangaea and thus with a period of once again, increased volcanism. The world still hadn’t fully recovered from the previous mass extinction when this one began but it would after this one. The Triassic period marked a time of competition between groups of animals for dominance over the land. There were many groups contending for the position, and among them were the dinosaurs. During this time dinosaurs still hadn’t claimed their rule over the land as the dominant vertebrates, but when this extinction eradicated many other kinds of large reptiles, dinosaurs moved into their niches and were the only type of large terrestrial vertebrate for the next almost 150 million years.",

The climate was favorable and the continents were breaking apart, creating fertile shallow seas and many miles of coast line which improved rain patterns. These conditions allowed dinosaurs to grow to enormous sizes, as both predator and prey attempted to gain the upper hand on one another. Sauropods were the extreme example, growing to sizes sometimes of over 100 feet in length, they used their size as a deterrent against predators and to control a niche in their environment that no other creature could access. They were eating machines designed to process huge amounts of foliage. And they did so so quickly that they had not time to chew. In fact, they ate small stones so that the plant matter would get ground up within their stomach's. Apatosaurus is probably the most well known of all sauropods, but is likely known by it's older name by many which is Brontosaurus.",

Traditionally, they were viewed as slow lumbering beasts that lived near swamps to support their weight. They were also usually depicted with their necks craning and moving like those of swans. However, recent research shows that they were more capable of carrying their own weight and their necks were actually more stiff than expected. This was because their size forced them to be built like suspension bridges, with their long necks supported by their tails as counterweights.",

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of Nobel prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160 and 20 times in three sections originally studied).",

This is because the equation for kinetic energy depends on the mass of the object and the square of its speed. Because the Earth's gravity does a lot to speed up the asteroid, it can reach speeds of several kilometers per second. If the object is small, friction from the atmosphere will tend to vaporize it before it reaches the ground creating meteors, also known as falling stars. But if the object is large, there isn't much that can slow it down and when it collides with earth it unleashes a lot of devastation. The one that wiped out the dinosaurs is thought to have been between 6 and 9 miles long.",

It is the most recent and infamous for the disappearance of all non-avian dinosaurs. For years the reason behind the extinction event went unknown, until Professor Walter Alvarez discovered a layer of Iridium that suggested an asteroid impact. After many years of research and the discovery of a large crater on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, it is now well established that the demise of the dinosaurs came from outer space. The impact created a tsunami that ravaged the Atlantic coast and the heat from it caused forest fires all over the north America. The rock that was ejected from the impact flew into space rained fire back down onto the earth, making the devastation global. The event caused essentially every creature larger than 50 pounds to die out, wiping out all dinosaur species, except for birds and leaving mammals and empty world to populate.",

The first species that is believed to have tamed fire is Homo erectus around 1.5 Ma.

Under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the empire became the most powerful state in the world, a multinational, multilingual empire controlling much of southeast Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. For six centuries the Ottoman Empire's vast influence around the Mediterranean basin made it the centre of interaction between the Eastern and Western worlds. After its capture in 1453, Constantinople became the capital city of the Ottoman Empire until its dissolution in the 20th century.",

Originally, it was published every other day, but it developed into a daily newspaper in Korean with an estimated average circulation of between two and three thousand copies.

Thwarted by conservative factions within the Joseon court, particularly the pro-Chinese Sugup'a, they launched a coup d'état attempt with Japanese support, seizing the royal palace in Seoul. Facing this threat, Queen Min secretly requested Qing military intervention, and after three days, the revolt was suppressed by 1500 troops of the Qing garrison led by General Yuan Shikai.",

Like other Korean Confucian academies, Dosan Seowon serves two purposes: education and commemoration. The site was well known in Korea as one of the leading academies and was home to the Toegye School of Thought for over 400 years. Although the educational function of the facility has long since ceased, the commemorative ceremonies have been and are still held twice a year.",

For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual.

The first references to older, first generation turtle ships, known as Gwiseon (귀선), come from 1413 and 1415 though they are more famous for their role in the Japanese Invasion of Korea in the 16th century. The turtle ship was the fastest and most maneuverable existing warship in the East Asian theater, as it was powered by two sails and 80 oarsmen taking turns to handle the ship's 16 oars. Its primary role was to cut deep into the enemy lines, cause havoc with its cannons, and destroy the enemy flag ship.",

However, their historical role may have been exaggerated since \"the entire Korean fleet probably did not have more than half a dozen turtleboats in action at any one time\". Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin is credited with designing the ship. His turtle ships were equipped with at least five different types of cannons. Their most distinguishable feature was a dragon-shaped head at the bow (front) that could launch cannon fire or flames from the mouth. Each was also equipped with a fully covered deck to deflect arrow fire, musket-shots, and incendiary weapons. The deck was covered with iron spikes to discourage enemy men from attempting to board the ship. Claims that it was iron plated remain controversial.",

Therefore, Admiral Yi ordered the fleet to feign withdrawal, which the Japanese commander observed from his tent on a rock. Then the Japanese hurriedly embarked their 12 ships and pursued the Korean fleet. The Korean navy counterattacked, with their newly completed Turtle Ship in the front, and successfully destroyed all 12 ships. Admiral Yi was shot by a bullet in his left shoulder, but survived successfully leading the Koreans to a resounding victory in the battle.",

Thus, the AfroEurAsian Old World (including the Indian Ocean) must comprise the remaining one-third of earth’s surface.

It is recognized as one of the most memorable plays in college football history. After Stanford had taken the lead on a field goal with four seconds left in the game the Bears used five lateral passes on the return to score the winning touchdown and victory. Midway through the return members of the Stanford Band rushed the field believing the game was over. To this day they play sparks intense disagreement.",

The students remained peaceful at their sit-in at the Plaza and Mario Savio gave his famous speech on the steps of Sproul Hall. Around midnight a call for a mass arrest was made. The police arrested close to 800 students who were bussed to the Dublin Jail. They were released on their own after a few hours, but the University pressed chargers against the students who organized the sit in.

Ritter seared for eleven years for an appropriate place and spent summers at various places along the coast with students. Then in 1903 Ritter was introduced to newspaper magnate E. W.

In 1960 special training was inaugurated by the College of Agriculture, and post-graduate division was started under a Graduate Division in 1961. In 1970, the all purpose College of Letters and Sciences was dissolved and was taken by colleges of Humanities, Physical Sciences, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and a Division of Undergraduate Studies. UC Riverside perpetuated a small college atmosphere while incorporating the advantages of a major university. ",

That demo is available to the public online, and a second version rewritten in HTML5 is now available and open source in beta form. ChronoZoom was inspired by the study of Big History, and it approaches the documentation and visualization of time and history in the same way that Google Earth deals with geography.  ChronoZoom allows users to see the true scale of time over cosmic, geologic, biological and social periods.",

In some fields, data from many different archives can be cross-correlated to produce new insights.

It was a puzzling find for Mantell who did not immediately know what to make of such large bones and teeth but ultimately gave it the name Iguanodon because the teeth were similar to those of a very large iguana.

The Spaniards were surprised to see stone cities along the coast of the Yucatan and landed in several different cities.

In AD 537, they seized Portus and, now having Rome’s crucial supply link in their possession, the Ostrogoths then besieged Rome (Procopius, History of the Wars of Justinian V.26.3-19). The siege lasted a year and resulted in disease and famine for both sides since although the Ostrogoths held Portus, the Byzantines had control of the seas. Suffering from lack of supplies, Vittigis ordered the Ostrogoths to abandon Portus which was then immediately occupied by the Isaurians (Procopius, History of the Wars of Justinian VI.7).",

A new hexagonal harbour basin was excavated inland behind the Claudian basin and associated infrastructure was constructed around it including warehouses, a possible ship shed, a temple and an expansive and lavishly decorated administrative building which was later dubbed the Palazzo Imperiale. At least one canal, mentioned by Pliny (Epistulae VIII.17.1-2) and possibly also referred to in a fragmentary inscription (CIL XIV 88 = CIL VI 964), was created by Trajan as well. The inauguration of Trajan’s work at Portus was commemorated with a coin issue displaying a bird’s eye view of the hexagonal harbour on the reverse.",

However Ostia’s harbour was too small to admit large ships like those which carried grain, an essential import for the populous capital. Large ships either had to dock further out and have smaller ships unload their cargo piecemeal or dock into the harbour at Pozzuoli and have the cargo unloaded and then taken overland to Rome. \r\nSuetonius notes (Diuus Claudius XX.1) that the creation of a large harbour to accommodate these ships was considered and then abandoned by Julius Caesar in the first century BC as too difficult an undertaking. Despite the enormity of the project and its substantial cost, Claudius initiated the construction of the large artificial harbour on the north side of the Tiber mouth in AD 42.",

Also Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia IX.5.14-15) relates the story of Claudius trapping a killer whale at Portus by closing off the mouth of the harbour with nets and then engaging it in combat.",

Significant phases of construction are also undertaken in other areas of the Palazzo Imperiale and in the area of the Grandi Magazzini Traianei to the south-west of the Trajanic harbour.",

He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\" by a newspaper reporter, he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large teamwork to the process of invention, and therefore is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. He is also the fourth most prolific inventor in history, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. ",

From his observations, Kepler elucidated three laws that describe the motions of celestial bodies in orbit, such as planets around the Sun. Kepler's laws are: 1. The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. 2. A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. 3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. ",

In 1748, Franklin wrote \"Advice to a Young Tradesman,\" which recommended that one should “remember that time is money.” Franklin described the meaning of this proverb by comparing a man's earnings for an entire day's work to the earnings of a man who idles half the day. “Though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness,” Franklin explained, “he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.” Because one can earn wages from an hour's work, an hour wasted is the equivalent of losing those same wages in addition to the money that was spent during such leisure time.",

His invention is widely cited as the beginning of the Horological Revolution. The pendulum clock, and the other innovations that accompanied it thereafter, allowed for the production of clocks that were cheaper and more accurate. For the first time, people outside the aristocracy and royalty could afford to own clocks and even more importantly pocket watches, which allowed for personalized timekeeping. Prior to Huygens, clocks could not be relied on for accuracy beyond an expected error of 15 minutes per day. The pendulum helped reduce that margin of error to about 10-15 seconds.",

The watch became “a continual source of anxiety” and so Fearnleaf got rid of it. This suggests an attitude towards timekeeping that may not have been obvious to those writing about an apparently self-evident need for time reform. Waugh does ascribe one significant inconvenience to lacking an accurate watch: Oliver Fearnleaf always misses the train...",

Smiles' most famous work, Self-Help, represents a great many beliefs at the heart of British cultural identity. This identity included a belief in the phrase \"time is money.\" Smiles advised that time should be “employed in good works.” If hours of indolence were put to proper use, they would “make an ignorant man wise in a few years.”",

Although Savery's initial design proved to be impractical due to several key flaws, it laid the foundation for more effective designs in the 18th century.",

With developments to power looms by Cartwright and others over the next few decades, the process eventually became completely automated.",

The Newcomen engine featured only a single chamber, into which jets of steam and cold water were alternately injected. This cycle of heating and cooling proved to be inefficient, and much of the steam potential was lost. Watt created a separate condensation chamber connected to the main chamber. Cold water was injected only into the condenser, allowing for condensation without significant heat loss and far greater fuel efficiency than the Newcomen engine.",

The Great Stink, or the Big Stink, was a time in the summer of 1858 which the smell of untreated human waste was very strong in central London. Until the late 16th century London citizens relied on water from shallow wells, the River Thames, its tributaries, or natural springs so the water was not abstracted for unauthorised commercial or industrial purposes. For seven years human waste was dumped into the Thames and then potentially pumped back to the same households for drinking, cooking and bathing. ",

After the Great Stink of 1858, Parliament resolved to create a modern sewerage system. Joseph Bazalgette designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the Thames Estuary, downstream of the main centre of population. ",

Maritime trade between England and China began in the 17th century. However, there was a far greater European demand for Chinese goods, such as tea, silk, and porcelain, and little Chinese interest in European goods. As a result, Chinese goods were paid for in silver. In an attempt to stem and reverse the vast flow of silver out of Britain, the East India Company began to sell the addictive and mass-appealing effects of Indian-produced opium to Chinese dealers, in exchange for silver. Recognizing the effects of addiction in its population, Chinese leaders placed bans on opium save in small amounts for medicinal purposes. However, opium continued to be smuggled into and sold in China in the mid-19th century, where tensions culminated in the First and Second Opium Wars.",

His work, most notably the 1848 manuscript \"The Communist Manifesto\", not only became foundational texts in the newly developing field of political economy, but emerged as the leading challenge to growing capitalist economic hegemony. Marx's influence inspired political revolutions all over the world, even decades after his death.",

However, as a result, a new constitution was established, stating that a president was to be elected by the people every four years.

The piece was initially commissioned by the King of Spain, and depicts a highly romanticized rendition of Bonaparte's crossing of the Alps through the Great St. Bernard Pass in May 1800. Five separate versions of this painting were created, at Bonaparte's request, to be displayed in different prominent buildings. The above image is the original version, which remained in Madrid until 1812, before being taken to the United States by Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother. It currently resides at the museum of the Château de Malmaison in France.",

Carrying passengers between Liverpool and Manchester in North West England, The L&MR was the first inter-city railway with fully scheduled trains, as well as being solely powered by steam locomotives. The opening day of the LM&R was greeted with much fanfare, although the festivities were tragically marred by the death of Liverpool Member of Parliament William Huskisson, who accidentally fell onto the tracks and was killed by an oncoming train. Despite its sombre beginnings, the L&MR rapidly grew to be a tremendous success.",

The \"Golden Spike\" (aka \"The Last Spike\") is the ceremonial final spike driven by Leland Stanford to join the rails of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the US connecting the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads. A transcontinental railroad is a continuous network of railroad trackage that crosses a continental land mass with terminals at different oceans or continental boarders. The \"Last Spike\" has been used to refer to one driven at the usually ceremonial completion of any new railroad construction projects. The \"Last Spike\" now lies in the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University.",

Carnegie Steel Company was a steel producing company created by Andrew Carnegie to manage business at his steel mills in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area in the late 19th century. Because of Carnegie, it now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and armor plate for the US Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. Carnegie installed improved systems that greatly sped up the process of steelmaking and allowed the production of far vaster quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force (especially the less skilled workers) also grew rapidly. ",

He is shown wearing the cap and greatcoat of the Imperial Horse-Guards Regiment. Alexander II is also known as Alexander the Liberator. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to end a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia, and as a result emancipation committees were formed. The Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. ",
