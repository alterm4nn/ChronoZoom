An estimated 1.2 million people visit. Covering the National Mall from the Washington Monument to the grounds of the U.S. Capital Building, The Quilt occupied an area equal to 24 football fields.\r\n\r\nPresident William J. Clinton attends the national Quilt display on the Mall, along with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. He is the first U.S. President to visit a display of The AIDS Memorial Quilt.\r\n\r\n“I remember when Hillary and I walked on the Mall to see The Quilt. It was a personally emotional thing, seeing the love and devotion that those sections of The Quilt represented for all those people who died prematurely, and knowing that now, with medicine, they didn’t have to die so fast anymore, if we did the right things. It was a very emotional day.” — President William J. Clinton",

In 1987 when the first panel of The Quilt was constructed, public officials were debating mandatory testing and mandatory quarantines of infected citizens. Homophobic reaction to HIV/AIDS was rampant. First dubbed the “Gay Plague” and the disease of drug addicts, HIV/AIDS was a companion to prejudice and ignorance. The Quilt became a unifying force both for the gay community and for society. Quilt tours became a venue for peaceful demonstration; an opportunity for all people to stand together and honor those lost to AIDS and a means to support the gay community.",

Hope surges when AIDS researcher David Ho, MD, suggests\r\ntreatment could eliminate HIV from the body.  He's wrong -- it's later found that\r\nHIV hides in dormant cells.  In one year, deaths from AIDS in the US decline by more\r\nthan 40%.",
