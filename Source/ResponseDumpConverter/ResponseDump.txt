Around 600 million years ago, the world was thrust into this ice age because much of the CO2 in the atmosphere was sequestered by plankton and taken out of the carbon cycle by being deposited as limestone. This reduction in greenhouse gases caused temperatures to plummet to an extraordinary degree, causing a global winter that only subsided after enough CO2 had been returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes. It is thought that this pressure on life around at the time sped up evolution and created the more resilient body plans that we see today.","Date":null,"HasBibliography":false,"ID":"7c0d33f2-47a2-4638-90ea-f02d82b9dde4","MediaSource":"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Fictional_Snowball_Earth_1_Neethis.jpg","MediaType":"Picture","Order":32767,"Regime":"Life","Threshold":"5.

The power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual.

Quan fa is a generic term used for open handed Chinese martial arts. Gwonbeop was developed based on the methods of the Shaolin Temple and the techniques of Jang Song Gye (장송계 hanja: 張松溪). The hanja for quan fa and gwonbeop are the same. The chapter in the muyedobotongji dealing with gwonbeop was inspired by Chinese writings describing quan fa-techniques.

One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation.

After many years of research and the discovery of a large crater on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, it is now well established that the demise of the dinosaurs came from outer space. The impact created a tsunami that ravaged the Atlantic coast and the heat from it caused forest fires all over the north America. The rock that was ejected from the impact flew into space rained fire back down onto the earth, making the devastation global. The event caused essentially every creature larger than 50 pounds to die out, wiping out all dinosaur species, except for birds and leaving mammals and empty world to populate.","Date":null,"HasBibliography":false,"ID":"ec4f6e46-3518-418e-85c1-9c04b7d950f7","MediaSource":"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Asteroid_1.png","MediaType":"Picture","Order":32767,"Regime":"Life","Threshold":"5.

In the late 1970s, following the discovery of other minor planets in the outer Solar System and the recognition of Pluto's relatively low mass, its status as a major planet began to be questiond. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined what it means to be a \"planet\" within the Solar System: 1) the oject must be in orbit around the Sun; 2) the object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force; and 3) it just have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto fails to meet the third condition, since its mass in only 0.07 times that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit.
