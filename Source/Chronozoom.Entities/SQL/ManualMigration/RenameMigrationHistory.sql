/*
    It is important to rename the __MigrationHistory table to prevent
    Entity Framework from performing a schema version check.
    
    EXEC sp_rename '__MigrationHistory', 'MigrationHistory' does not work if table was previously
    marked as a system table using sp_MS_marksystemobject. So, we will create a new table from scratch,
    move the data from the old table to the new table, then delete the old table.
    
    Note that we don't use sp_MS_marksystemobject as this is not supported in Azure.
    It actually isn't required and was only used to hide the table, not for any other purpose.
