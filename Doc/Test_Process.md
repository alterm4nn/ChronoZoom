# ChronoZoom Test Process #

ChronoZoom team members can request test cases for features. 

This document summarizes the process to be used by ChronoZoom team members for requesting test cases for new features and bug fixes.

1. Navigate to the [QA Trello board](https://trello.com/board/qa/513ed8f7059730440f001bed).
2. Create a new card in the **Inbox** column. This card should contain:
    - Link to the developer's card.
    - Link to the related user story.
    - Link to test.chronozoomproject.org.
    - Link to the source code.
    - List of feature owners.
    - List of developers who are involved with the feature.
    - Any information that will provide better understanding for the testers.
    - Labels
        - New Feature.
        - Regression (if existing functionality has changed).
3. Tester assigns card to him/her self.
4. Tester defines all details.
5. When the card is ready for testing, tester moves to the **Design** column.
6. Tester creates test cases for the card and moves to the **Execution** column.
7. Tester executes tests for the card, files bugs and creates a test report.
8. Tester sends an email to the team describing the results.
9. Tester moves the card to **Done** once all bugs have been files and the report is complete.
