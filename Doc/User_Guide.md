## Introduction ##

Language changes how our brains perceive and interpret information. The very words we use to describe the world can transform our perception of it.

Did you know that Aboriginal Australians don't have a word for left or right? Their language developed around their method of orientation to the points of the compass. A native speaker of the Aboriginal language wouldn't say turn left at the crossroads. Instead, the native speaker would advise someone looking for directions to turn east. This focus in their language shaped how the Aboriginals view information about geography and orientation.

ChronoZoom is an intuitive online tool used to visualize all of time, from the Big Bang to today, using the concept of zooming into the canvas to express the scope of time. The way ChronoZoom interprets time might seem a little strange at first. Native English speakers have been trained to think of time sequentially and expressed solely in terms of a number line. However, using only dates to chronicle points in time can hide the magnificent scope of the breadth of time. For example, students who read that the Big Bang occurred 13.7 billion years ago may not be able to comprehend how vast that length of time is. When you see ChronoZoom zoom from the Industrial Revolution all the way back to the Big Bang, you can see how depth provides an entirely new way to visualize time.

You can browse through history on ChronoZoom to find data in the form of articles, images, video, sound, and other multimedia. ChronoZoom links a wealth of information from five major regimes that unify all historical knowledge collectively known as Big History.

In the next section we will cover the five regimes in detail. By drawing upon the latest discoveries from many different disciplines, you can visualize the temporal relationships between events, trends, and themes. Some of the disciplines that contribute information to ChronoZoom include biology, astronomy, geology, climatology, prehistory, archaeology, anthropology, economics, cosmology, natural history, population, and environmental studies. We expect to expand the number of disciplines over time, providing users with more information to help them develop new insights into the past as well as the future.

## Regimes ##

Big History divides time into five major regimes:

- Cosmos
- Earth
- Life
- Human Pre-History
- Humanity

A Regime covers a specified period of time. Some regimes are vastly larger than others. For example, the Humanity regime covers an infinitesimally small fraction of the time covered by the Cosmos regime.

The Regime Key can be found in the upper-right corner of ChronoZoom as shown above. Each color represents a specific Regime and this color scheme is followed throughout the timelines inside of each Regime.

The physical representation of the regime scales is not completely accurate. Humanity and Human-Pre History have been artificially inflated to show the user where they are at all times. Vertical order represented in the key is not reflected in the canvas.

By clicking on one of the Regime names, you can zoom to that Regime. The lines in the gray box contrast the differences in length of the Regimes and show your current location.

ChronoZoom visually moves the screen through every Regime until you hit your target.

## Timelines ##

A timeline is a specified period of history within a Regime. Each timeline can be divided into additional sub-timelines. Different disciplines, such geology and history, categorize time in different unit and thus some Exhibits (collections of multimedia content tied to a specific historical event of interest) may show up in more than one sub-timeline.
