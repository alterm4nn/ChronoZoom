## Introduction ##

ChronoZoom is an open source community project dedicated to visualizing Big History that has been funded and supported by Microsoft Research Connections in collaboration with University California at Berkeley and Moscow State University.

You can browse through history on ChronoZoom to find data in the form of articles, images, video, sound, and other multimedia. ChronoZoom links a wealth of information from five major regimes that unifies all historical knowledge collectively known as Big History.

This guide covers everything you need know to install the ChronoZoom development environment tools, use GitHub to get ChronoZoom source code, and deploy ChronoZoom to an Azure hosted website.

If you are new to GitHub, we recommend reading [Learning to use GitHub for ChronoZoom development](/../LearningTouseGithub.md/) for more information on setting up your source code repository.

<!-- Note: Some of the APIs for ChronoZoom are not yet available for the public. -->

## Generate an SSH Key for GitHub Authentication ##
You can use SSH keys to establish a secure connection between your computer and GitHub. This is an alternative to cloning an HTTPS repository URL. The following example shows using the ssh-keygen utility to generate a new key, and then using the **clip** command to copy the key to the clipboard.

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@server.com" -f %userprofile%\.ssh\id_rsa`
`clip < %userprofile%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`

Once this is done you can add the SSH key to GitHub. For more detailed information, see [Generating SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).
-->

## Clone the ChronoZoom GitHub Repository ##
In order to get the source for ChronoZoom, you will need to install [Git for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git) and clone the GitHub repository. This section shows you how.

1. If you have not already done so, sign up for [GitHub](http://github.com).
1. Go to: [https://github.com/alterm4nn/ChronoZoom](https://github.com/alterm4nn/ChronoZoom). This is the master branch for the project.
1. Fork the repo by clicking **Fork**. For more information see [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

1. Clone the fork to your local computer by running the following command:
    `git clone https://github.com/[your-GitHub-ID]/ChronoZoom.git`

    You now have your own fork of the ChronoZoom project.

1. Add a remote for the master repository by running the following commands:
    ```
    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
    cd ChronoZoom
    # Assign the original repo to a remote called "blessed".
    git remote add blessed https://github.com/alterm4nn/ChronoZoom.git
    # Get the latest changes from blessed:
    git checkout master
    git pull blessed master
    ```
1. In your GitHub repository, create a [topic branch](http://learn.github.com/p/branching.html). Topic branches are typically lightweight branches that you create locally and that have a name that is meaningful for you. They are where you might do work for a bug fix or feature (they're also called feature branches). The following command shows using  the git **checkout** command to create a topic branch:

    `git checkout -b branch_name`
    
    Make all of your changes in the topic branch, and consider the master branch to be an "untouched" master that can be updated to get the latest changes with `git pull`.

<!--
+* Launch source\chronozoom.sln
+* Enable EnableNuGetPackageRestore (Right click on VS Solution - Enable NuGet Package Restore)
+* Build/Deploy locally from Visual Studio
-->

## Deploy ChronoZoom to Azure ##
To test your changes, you will need to deploy ChronoZoom to Azure.

### Add a New Website ###

Login to [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).

At the bottom of the page, click the **+ NEW** bar and select the following options:

**Compute** -> **Web Site** -> **Custom Create**

In the **Create Web Site** dialog, fill in the fields as follows:

- **Url**: Enter a name for your website (in this example the website name is ***mycz***).
- **Region**: Leave the default value.
- **Database**: Select the **Create New Sql Database** option.
- **DB Connection String Name**: Enter "Storage" (omit quotation marks).
- **Publish from Source Control**: Checked
- Click the arrow icon to go to page 2.
	
### Specify Database Settings ###

Fill in the fields as follows:

- **Server**: Select **New SQL Database server**. It's okay to select a pre-existing database if you have already created one.
- **Login name**: Enter the user name for the database. In this example the user name is ***myDatabaseUsername***.
- **Password**: Enter the password for the database. In this example the password is ***myDatabasePassword***.
- Click the arrow icon to go to page 3.
	
### Specify Source Control Settings ###

- **Source Control Type**: Select **GitHub**.
- **Repository Location **: Select **Local Repository**.
	- It is possible to set up continuous replication from GitHub here, however this example uses a local repository for simplicity. For more details about continuous replication, read [this](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/common-tasks/publishing-with-git/).
- Click the arrow icon to go to page 4.
	
### New user name and password (for Git) ###

- **Username**: Enter a user name for Git. In this example it is ***myGitUsername***.
- **Password**: Enter a password for Git. In this example it is ***myGitPassword***.
	
### Go to Dashboard for Web Site ###

- Copy the Git Clone Url. It will be listed under **quick glance** in the right column, and will be something like: https://myGitUsername@mycz.scm.azurewebsites.net/mycz.git

### Add a connection to the Azure Web Site ###

- git remote add azure https://myGitUsername@mycz.scm.azurewebsites.net/mycz.git

Now you can make changes to the source code.

### Publish your changes to the Azure Web Site ###
Open the Git command prompt and use the following command. You will be prompted for your Azure password.

- git push --set-upstream azure master
 
### Preview Your Site! ###

Browse to http://**mycz**.azurewebsites.net/ and behold your own copy of ChronoZoom! Your site URL is listed in the **quick glance** column of the Azure dashboard. For operational management details, see [Chronozoom Operations Guide](Doc/ChronoZoom_Operations_Guide.md).
