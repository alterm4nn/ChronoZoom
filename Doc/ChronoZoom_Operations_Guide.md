# ChronoZoom Operations Guide #
You can use the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) to configure and monitor your ChronoZoom site (and any other sites or resources that you have created on Azure). This guide summarizes the most common tasks that you will need to perform on Azure, and contains links to more detailed information where appropriate.

When you first sign in to Azure, you are presented with a list of resources. The Web site that you are using to host ChronoZoom should appear within this list along with the associated SQL database.

Along the bottom of the page are several options: **New**, **Browse**, **Stop**, **Restart**, **Manage Domains**, **Delete**, and **Help**. Clicking the **Help** icon will display help content for whichever tab you are currently working in. The contents of the bottom bar will change depending on the tab you are in.
